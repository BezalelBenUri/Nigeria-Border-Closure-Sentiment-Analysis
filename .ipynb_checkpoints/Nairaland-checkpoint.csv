That, and our not too strong currency,We have a poor mechanization level in our agriculture, and we don't have the large wetland of Thailand and Brazil.border closure was just propaganda. The reality is, until we have more mechanized and scientific farming, we won't get to be a big rice producer."

If  the price remains same before this administration hand over the  Batton , then it means the rice project, border closure  thing is highly unnecessary and hoax"

23,,,Great. But this project should be sited at a major oil producing state like Imo state with the likes of shell anoh gas project not at Lagos. He should source for his oil from the 30 liters of oil Lagos produce. SMH for nigeria.****modified**** for those quoting me and talking about security and dangote buying oil from elsewhere. There is insecurity in oil producing states but somehow bonny terminal has been used to export nigeria crude oil for many years without issues. Remind me again whose job it is to provide security again? All these insecurity shit is political because it serves the interest of some power blocks. We all know the kind of business model dangote operates. He cant do without the heavily subsidized nigerian oil from nepostic government monopoly. Please you guys should remind me again where kaduna refinery is getting her crude from again? didnt nigeria government pipe oil from here to kaduna? Hypocritical NIGERIANS!everybody dey here when erisco foods was begging cbn to release his dollar so that he can  buy essential raw materials but the government refused but was selling forex at a very cheap rate to dangote while other companies was just begging to have access to their own personal money. What about during the border closure and lockdown? dangote was given waiver to continue plying his trade while other industrialists cried. IT IS ALL POLITICS AND POWERFUL INTERESTSshout out to all legit businessmen and women that have made names for themselves through hardwork and shear business acumen without corrupt and tribalistic government suppressing their competitions

25,,,"What make you think 500k is a lot of money enough to relocate to Cotonou or Accra? The Naira has lost its value so much. 1. The cost of transportation from Lagos to either of the two cities has triple cos of border closure due to covid out break.2. Accommodation in both cities have increased in recent times due to the economic impact of covid.3. Before you can rent an apartment in both cities, you will have to acquire a RP, this wasn't the case few years back but cos the present Nigerian govt have failed in its diplomatic duties for its citizens residents in those countries, the hosts are now more hostile and strict about undocumented Nigerians in their country.  Moreover, applying for a RP will eat into your already little budget. 4. Both cities have constant electricity supply but very expensive.5. Cost of living particularly in Accra is far more than that of Lagos so be prepared. My advice: if you must relocate, up your budget to at least 1.5million to avoid getting stranded or been arrested for illegal stay in especially Accra."

He was fraudulently propagated by the ethnically biased FG of nigeria that killed ibeto cement, just to help dangote to the top.Dangote doesn't  follow the laid down procedures that are mandated for others to obey. He does not obey border closure and even treated with kid gloves. How am i even sure if he pay taxes.... That the FG use taxes to kill other competitive companies is another topic for another day entirely on it own.As long as am concerned this country remains a joke of a country that does not want to promote equity, equality, fairness and transparency based on ethnic variance.It's been programmed for total dominance by the fulanis and their willing and obedient slaves."

He recently signed a deal with the French govt to build a refinery in Akwa Ibom I think.What you said about the politics being behind most of the bad press Dangote gets is true. Funny enough most of his detractors had no issues with him when OBJ and GEJ where in charge. I not an expert about the goings on in the cement industry but someone who helped stop your country being an import dependent one when it comes to cement deserves commendation. At least companies like Lafarge have been on ground before Dangote ventured into cement business why didn't they think of expanding instead of largely relying on imports?Don't be surprised when his refinery is up and running and he's enjoying the profits of his investment they will accuse him of monopoly even though a lot of them were given licenses to refine crude years ago.Buhari has many faults but one good I've seen is if you're a large scale Nigerian business trying to expand they give you the necessary backing whether through monetary policy, government policy like border closure and encouraging local substitute for imported raw materials."

33,,,"Taxes have never made an economy grow in any part of the world.Production does. That's where nigeria's government has missed it all these years You can't tax your way into prosperity or economic growth And imposing tax on your citizens because you have imbalance of trade is not going to improve your export, IGR, FDI or GDP If you produce, they won't be able to export to your economy.  Buhari border closure achieved what exactly? That's him trying to stop importation (rice).No country is interested in getting you benefits if all you do is import from them or giving you something in return as you point out above.It's not critical thinking that is required. It's economics. That's why the economy hasn't grown in 20 years, because people that think like you are those making the lousy decisions all these years. The results are evident.Public infrastructure can not be funded from taxes too. All those things you listed above there are just white elephants you know can't be achieved."

In the absence of measures to contain inflation, rising prices will continue to diminish the welfare of Nigerian households.”The bank further highlighted the adverse effects of inflation on nigeria, which include pushing eight million Nigerians into poverty, and the possible disruption of consumption, investment and saving decisions, among other consequences.“If inflation had been closer to the CBN’s goal of nine per cent in 2021, the average nigeria’s consumption would have been 15 per cent higher, and eight million Nigerians would have not fallen into poverty.“If double-digit inflation persists during 2022-2023, rising prices will distort consumption, investment, and saving decisions of the government, households, and firms, with adverse ramifications for long-term borrowing and lending.“Over time, the disproportionate impact of inflation on lower-income households and those working in sectors with low savings (e.g, agriculture) will exacerbate inequality. Ultimately, inflation will not only negatively affect incomes, but also economic productivity and job creation, further constraining the recovery,” the bank said.The Washington, United States-based institution also disclosed that over two years, an increase in food prices accounted for about 70 per cent of the annual increase in the rate of inflation.It also said that inflationary pressures were trigged by multiple demand and supply shocks.The document read in part, “Inflationary pressures are being generated by multiple demand and supply shocks. Supply shocks arising from disruption of supply chains linked to COVID-19 and associated containment measures have eased, but security issues, border closures, and limited access to markets continue to fuel inflation.“The current mix of monetary, fiscal, foreign exchange, and trade policies also plays a prominent role as a driver of inflation. Trade and FX restrictions, including the closure of land borders starting in August 2019, have increased prices for food and consumer goods, and imports of over 40 goods, including many staple foods, are currently ineligible for FX through formal windows.“nigeria’s exchange-rate management has resulted in the rise of parallel rates, which are closely linked to food-price dynamics.

Except if you call 419, yahoo yahoo, poverty, robberies and pr0stitution benefits.Ghana objected to the border closure by nigeria strictly because it violated ecowas protocols on free movement . By the way, Ghana’s land borders have been closed for the past two years because of covid and Ghana’s economy is still growing strong.nigeria closed its borders for just one year and they are still counting the cost in that shiithole. Prices of food and everything went through the roof due to the border closure. Buhari had to open the borders when hunger started killing the imbeciles. People were and are still shouting hunger hunger in that zoo. Your high commissioner in Accra has been begging the Ghana government to open Ghana’s borders.

If you are waiting for western countries to score you high in all aspect of governance in nigeria, I am sorry you will be waiting for sun at night.Buhari listening to those neo-colonialist are even the source of our problem. World bank, IMF, even WHO and NGOs are all fake and tools for neo-colonialism. They are all pro-western countries for their special interests.The main reason Buhari is made to fail is because the majority of northern elites are not supporting his government, Buhari called them thieves which they actually are hence this sabotage on all facet be it security or economy we are seeing today.Government policy is not formulated by Mr president alone. Tell me one policy that Buhari introduced that has no good intentions and not good to our economy that people could not see and kick against right from 2015.There is no way this old former presidents will allow Buhari to outshine them.Buhari failed because we voted him to apply gamalin on these ""economic pests"", these useless mafians who thinks nigeria is theirs before others but decided to be fighting them instead of crushing them, so the grass must suffer from the two elephants fight."

Is it by the unfortunate hands of kismet, that recession hits nigeria every time Buhari takes charge of the country’s affairs? If the recession of the 80s under Buhari was a conspiracy by economic and political factors, to what do we attribute that of his first coming as a civilian president — and now in his second coming? Why does pestilence scourge the land, hunger ravage the population and lives lost malevolently when Buhari presides over the country? Why always Buhari?Buhari’s undoing is his wonted predilection for hierarchising ethnicity, religion and loyalty above competence. Since 1999, no president has obtrusively shown a more nepotistic aspect than Buhari. It is unarguable that the president arrays the most competence-challenged cabinet ever in the chronicle of governance in nigeria. Yes, a recession cabinet.Here is a cabinet constituting of figures stuck in a time when the world only saw pictures in black and white — characters from Pinocchio who see social media as a threat and troglodytes who think farming with hoe and cutlass is progress.Buhari’s agriculture minister, Sabo Nanono, once said there is no hunger in nigeria and that food is cheap in the country. Wait! Before you tag this as fake news read his exact words and be flummoxed.“I think we are producing enough to feed ourselves. I think there is no hunger in nigeria; there could be inconveniences. When people talk about hunger in this government, I just laugh. In this country, it is fairly cheap to buy food,’’ the minister said at a press briefing to mark the 2019 World Food Day in Abuja on October 15, 2019.This is one among the foundering protagonists of the Buhari administration. When native complexion and loyalty are prioritised above competence and performance, leadership suffers. I strongly believe even if nigeria’s constitution allows a third term and Buhari returns in 2023, recession will hit the country again. It appears anything he touches atrophies.Buhari is the type of boss every bungling brownnoser would like to work with. He rewards failure in the currency of loyalty. As long as you keep him sated with praises, you can keep your job. Why have the service chiefs who have failed in their duty of keeping the country safe not been sacked? Why are they still in office long after their retirement is due?The recession of 2016 was largely due to the incompetence of the Buhari government. Here is how Nairametrics, nigeria’s Bloomberg, puts it: “In a nutshell, what caused the last recession (of 2016) was not entirely the fall in oil prices. Rather, the lack of sound economic policies to diversify away from the volatility of crude oil prices, whilst boosting the nation’s non-oil exports, was also a major cause.”I concede, the recent recession (2020) is a corollary of the global economic meltdown compelled by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a steep drop in oil prices and Diaspora remittances, and the stock market is prostrate. But there were warnings of this impending doom before its fruition. What could Buhari’s recession team have done different?The World Bank in its June 25, 2020 report had projected that nigeria would slip into a severe economic recession, the worst since the 1980s. Shubham Chaudhuri, World Bank country director for nigeria, recommended: “While the long-term economic impact of the global pandemic is uncertain, the effectiveness of the government’s response is important to determine the speed, quality, and sustainability of nigeria’s economic recovery. Besides immediate efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and stimulate the economy, it will be even more urgent to address bottlenecks that hinder the productivity of the economy and job creation.’’Even if the 2020 recession was inevitable, the Buhari administration hastened its climax and ossified the severity by its harebrained economic policies. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Buhari government whimsically closed the land borders, taking food out of the table of many Nigerians.The World Bank in the same report entitled, ‘nigeria in Times of COVID-19: Laying Foundations for Strong Economic Recovery’, impliedly said the land border closure of 2019 made the 2020 doomsday inexorable. Talk about heating the furnace.It said: “Analysis of the impact of the 2019 border closure found that it contributed to higher inflation—especially true for food, despite the relatively little impact on agricultural output. Because of the rises in food prices, Nigerian consumers now need to pay 2 percent more for the same basket of goods, with negative effects on their consumption.”Why always Buhari?I think, with the latest recession, Buhari is the only Nigerian president that has presided over the country under multiple recessions.What a legacy!"

Images of massacres are too gruesome to watch and the stories from survivors too heartbreaking to hear but, hearing and watching we must, because this is the reality under which our people now live.These bandits roll into our towns and villages in convoys of motorcycles riding three on each, brandishing AK47 rifles. They spend hours killing, burning, raping, carting away livestock, and abducting women as sex slaves. They put taxes on the people and keep coming back, again and again to attack because of the absence of law enforcement to protect the people. Security personnel oftentimes show up after the carnage to count the bodies.It is not only tragic but shameful that these bunch of ragtag bandits on motorcycles wielding nothing more than rusty AK47 rifles can roam the land with impunity causing so many deaths and destruction in a nation with a standing Armed Forces and Police force.Anytime President Muhammadu Buhari talks about the insecurity bedeviling this nation either at home or at his many international outings, he refers only to Boko Haram without even acknowledging banditry and kidnapping as major security problems.The few times he talks about banditry, he admits he doesn’t “understand why people of the same religion and ethnicity are killing themselves”. Lately, he has jokingly added that he will speak to them “in the language they understand”. He usually concludes his remarks by saying that he has ordered the Military to be “ruthless” in dealing with them.The things I find most depressing about the President’s pronouncements and body language are: {1}. He seems distant and disconnected from the realities of our people,. {2}. He sees banditry as a Military problem that requires a Military solution, {3}. He does not appear  properly briefed on the causes and the existential threat that banditry poses to the nation, {4}. His unwillingness to understand banditry beyond the Military prism {5}. His refusal to widen his cycle of consultations beyond the Military to involve community leaders, traditional rulers, clerics, victims and their families and academics that have done excellent research on banditry.MEASURES THAT HAVE NOT WORKED{1}. border closure: closure of nigeria’s land borders for 16 months has not been effective in stemming the flow of illegal weapons into the country.{2}. “Rejigging the security architecture”: Which included changing the Service Chiefs and the Presidential directive to them to bring peace to the land so that farmers could return to their farms during the rainy season.{3}.

It is not a threat, but a warning. We’ve given an earlier warning so that nobody will blame us for our actions,” Richards said.BNL admitted that it was responsible for cross border activities and smuggling to Southern Cameroon, which has helped the Ambazonia separatists in the fight against Cameroon.He said that all the groups in Southern Cameroon rely on their assistance despite the denial of the alliance by some of their leaders.Biafra Nations League is a movement that claims it has direct links with the separatists in Southern Cameroon.

157,,,"The price of a big bag of brown beans has skyrocketed to N100,000 as traders lament low inventory and a significant increase in transportation cost as reasons for the sudden surge, Nairametrics reports.A big bag of brown beans, which sold within the range of N85,000 and N88,000 last week has now surged by over 17% to sell as high as N100,000 in major markets and stores around the city of Lagos.According to Nairametrics databank, the price of beans has increased by 140.96% year-to-date from N41,500 recorded as of December 2020 to sell for an average of N100,000 in Lagos. A further analysis, reveals the highly demanded food item has increased by 203% compared to the corresponding period of 2020.Low Inventory And Transport Cost Push Price Of Beans To N100,000In the same vein, nigeria’s consumer price index report shows that the food index rose by 20.3% in August 2021, representing a decline compared to 21.03% recorded in the previous month. It is worth noting that nigeria’s food index has maintained double-figure growth since June 2015. The galloping rate of food inflation has been attributed to a series of events that have further dampened the government’s effort towards food sufficiency in the country. These events include insecurity, border closure, disruption in the supply chain, infrastructural problem, amongst others. Why beans is suddenly the new goldBeans, which is a highly demanded food item, used in the making of many other delicacies such as bean pudding (“moi moi”), bean cake (“akara”), beans soup (“gbegiri”), and many others, has now hit a record high in terms of price.Meanwhile, Nigerians are beginning to react to this recent increase as Nairametrics inquired from traders on the possible causes of the sudden spike.According to Aisha, a dealer at Daleko market, the recent increase in the price of beans is due to low inventories at the market and a surge in transport cost. She explained that due to the increase in transport cost, the suppliers are forced to bring in stocks only once in two months, causing a double whammy of cost-push and demand-pull inflation.Likewise, Mr Kelechi who sells beans at Mile-12 market attested to the significant increase in the price of beans, which he termed “shocking.” According to him, it is definitely not a seasonal effect, because the price is way above the levels recorded as of this time last year.He, however, suggested it could have something to do with the level of insecurity ravaging the northern region of the country.What NBS data is sayingAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the price of brown beans sold in loosed containers increased by 62.4% year-on-year in August 2021 from N305.43 to an average of N496.03 in nigeria. The report also reveals that beans is cheapest in Bauchi State while it is most expensive in Ebonyi State.Similarly, the price of beans surged by 66.76% year-on-year in Lagos State, rising from an average of N290.76 to sell for N484.88. This is a massive jump in price for an economy where citizens are dealing with a host of other economic problems.SOURCE:https://brandspurng.com/2021/10/06/low-inventory-and-transport-cost-push-price-of-beans-to-n100000/"

169,,,"We have always known Coscharis to be a major player in the automobile industry. What informed your investment in nigeria’s agricultural sector?Unfortunately, lots of people thought that Coscharis derives its position of success from the auto industry. We have been around for 46 years and our experience in the auto industry is barely 20 or 22 years. Our core business can be regarded as the pharmaceutical of the automobile. Anybody that drives a car in nigeria is our customer and that is what is keeping us going. The automobile industry is growing but it is subjected to lots of variables such as government policy among others. It will be a surprise and a shock if I tell anybody that from January to date that I have not sold up to 30 Jaguar Land Rovers and 30 units of BMW. Our principals can testify because they ship the cars and would tell you how many they have shipped. That is why when we heard the story of smuggling, it can be another company and not Coscharis because I did not see what benefit it would be for me to smuggle less than 30 cars as a business to jeopardise the overall interest of our organisation.Our involvement in agriculture is not an accident as Cosharis has been playing a critical role in every sector of the economy. We are involved in pharmaceutical, medical equipment, information technology, mobility services and even the production of sachet water, as long as it is a legitimate business. Our rice farm has been a long-term plan. The piece of property where we are growing our rice is 32 years old. Emeka Omeruah was the governor of Anambra State – as a military administrator – when we purchased the land and got the certificate of occupancy. We have always known that this is what we are going to do. We only waited for an opportunity to present itself and when it was ripe to move, we did. We ensure that we built enough equity within the company and leveraged on borrowed funds to go into the integrated agro-industry from seed production to mechanised farming, processing, and packaging. It is a fully integrated farm.Once you do something of the international standard it attracts the attention of the international community. We have had an international investor in the name of Sahel who has brought in a lot of things to the board. Working with Sahel has helped us understand the need for compliance with how to run these plants. They brought new ideas to the board and how to ultimately make the business a success. We desire that in another four years or five, Coscharis Farms will be listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange and people will see the performance and the result that will come out. Our idea is to get Nigerians to share from the wealth we are creating.Anambra state has a comparative advantage in vegetable production so why rice production in particular?I think we have a more comparative advantage in rice production than vegetables, because if you look at the density of the population in Ebonyi, Imo, Delta, Abia, Enugu states that are surrounding Anambra and you understand that rice is wheat that grows on a mud. All you need to do is get a muddy area in which Anambra state has lots of river basin area for it. Rice grows well and better in Anambra than it can grow anywhere. We need to grow and mill rice in Anambra to service the eastern region. If you produce rice in Kano and bring it to Anambra there will be a difference of about N1,500 to N2,000 on transportation. Rice is as heavy as cement and the cost of transportation plays an important role in the ultimate cost of it. In the future, we will do something in Lagos or the southwest area to target those markets. Once we perfect our first mill and rice farm in Anambra, we would move to other states and regions. We have been given 20,000 hectares of land in Kogi state and we would take them one step at a time. We would take the business where they belong and where value can be added. Our first goal is to solve the food problem in Anambra State and the eastern axis. Once we do that we have the opportunity and experience to replicate it in other parts of the country.Do you think the recent border closure is the right way to go in tackling the smuggling of food items?The government has reasons for whatever they do and it will be wrong for me to say if it is a wrong decision. Until you hear their reasons behind it then you will know whether there are merits to it or not. But I think that as a country we should work hard to foster the economic cooperation of West Africa because nigeria will benefit more than in other countries. The Germans and France were behind the European Union and these are the two strong economic producers in Europe that galvanise the others to form the EU to be able to sell their products and have free trade. If we continue to close the border, whether it ultimately benefits us or not I do not know but I will tell you that it is value-added like everything in life there are positives and negatives.The positive of it today is that rice smuggling has reduced but it does not stop people from smuggling rice. What we need to do is to support farmers to grow capacity. As capacity grows, prices will drop; as prices drop it becomes uncompetitive for smugglers. As a farm, there are many things we have done which ordinarily should be the government doing. Take for instance; we spent N3 billion providing irrigation for our farms. Irrigation should be a government project to support the farms. If these infrastructures are given and capacity is built continuously, prices of a bag of rice will be drastically reduced and it will address smuggling.Why is Coscaris rice not available in major rice markets in Lagos as the state consumes over 70per cent of rice in the country?Many traders are re-bagging our rice into foreign brands because they say our rice is not of local quality and this is why you do not see them in the markets. We have stopped two of our distributors because of this.What type of reforms would you want to see the government come up with to ensure that nigeria attains self-sufficiency in rice production?There are lots of policies the government has put in place today that are working. They are supporting out-growers farmers; they are providing funds for serious investors like us. We have access to a N6billion loan from the central bank at 9percent which is still better than borrowing at 20 percent to do farm. I think the government should not ask for more than 5 percent because this is a way to support the farm. If we can spend so much amount of money on petroleum subsidy that we do not eat, then we should give farmers loans at zero interest rates as this is a way to counter competition for foreigners. No nation grows without feeding its people. The government should do more in agriculture and education. They should realign their priorities.In your assessment, how would you evaluate the Anchor Borrowers Scheme?I understand it is not working in some states but it is working in Anambra state. The programme in Anambra will be a model that other states can emulate. What we are trying to do now is to further partner with the farmers by giving them a high-yielding seed variety. We do not want to give them our seeds to double their yield and they sell to other millers, and then we have worked in futility.What are the problems with nigeria’s rice industry?Flooding is a big problem in the industry. Last year, our farm was overtaken by the flood. The Vice President visited to see the extent of the damage. We suffered a loss of over N2billion; some of our tanks collapsed because of the water level. The Vice President promised that we would be compensated but we never got anything. We later read in the newspapers that the Executive Council budgeted and approved N7billion but Coscharis did not get anything and we are still wondering who the beneficiaries were. There are also community issues but we have experienced peace in Anambra with our host community https://businessday.ng/agriculture/article/we-want-to-list-coscharis-farms-on-the-nigerian-stock-exchange-in-five-years/Lalasticlala"

191,,,"Josephine OkojieAug 26, 2021Farmers on fieldFor several decades, long before nigeria gained independence in 19[url][/url]60, agriculture was the main driver of economic growth and development. However, the discovery of crude oil at Oloibiri in present-day Bayelsa state in 1956, four years before nigeria’s independence, changed the narrative in agricultural capacity. It prompted the country to lag in the production of almost all food crops and commodities.Long years of disinvestment and the inability of Africa’s most populous country to sustain and improve its food production, has led to a sharp decline in productivity.However, succour came to Africa’s biggest economy when its government began making efforts to tap opportunities across the agricultural value chains to create millions of jobs and earn foreign exchange amid revenue shortfalls.The government is seeking to stimulate socio-economic development through agriculture and pivotal in this drive is the Central Bank of nigeria (CBN) through intervention programmes such as the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP), the Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) and Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme among other agricultural credit schemes.The ABP initiative, which started in 2016 to provide single-digit interest rates for smallholder farmers and guarantee off-takers in key staples has impacted the country’s agricultural sector tremendously and increased food production.Also, it spurred demand in crop and livestock products across the country and created investment opportunities for potential investors across the agricultural value chains, among others. Under the scheme, the country has increased local rice production significantly and is now able to meet up with local demand for the grain.The ABP initiative has led to an increase in the country’s paddy production from about four million to seven million metric tons annually, according to data obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).Read also: Access Bank launches awareness campaign to combat e-banking fraudNumbers of rice mills both integrated and cottage mills, have also increased by more than 50 percent as the government and private sector continue to make more investments in processing.Similarly, the average yield of the crop has risen from 2.5 metric tons per hectare to an average of five metric tons of the same acreage, owing to the initiative.Currently, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has projected nigeria’s mid-year 2021/22 rice production to hit 9million tons, a 20percent increase compared to other mid-year projections.According to the USDA, Nigerian farmers are increasingly moving from singular seasonal rice farming to multiple seasons.“The prospects of multiple cropping rice seasons are contributing to increased national production,” USDA said in its report.Also, data from the Thai rice exporters association shows that nigeria imported a total of 436 metric tons in the first-five months of 2021 valued at $210,463 (N86.3million based on official exchange rate of N410 per dollar) as against 1,029 metric tons in the corresponding period of 2020, valued at $450,992 (N185 million).This shows a 57.6 percent decrease in 2021 – despite farmers in major rice growing regions challenged by the devastating effects of climate change.“Lots of rice farmers are increasing their production areas because there is a huge market for paddy today than before,” Aminu Goronyo, national president, Rice Farmers Association of nigeria told BusinessDay in a 2020 interview.“This is because millers are patronizing rice farmers now and off-taking all that they produce immediately,” Goronyo said.Under the initiative, the apex bank said it has disbursed N756.5billion to 3,734,938 smallholder farmers, cultivating 4.6 million hectares of land, to boost food security, and rice farmers are the major beneficiaries.Godwin Emefiele, CBN’s governor in an interview said the apex bank is ready to offer effective partnership to deliver on the country’s critical national mandate of attaining self-sufficiency in food production.Emefiele said the ABP, which is an essential part of President Muhammadu Buhari’s drive for economic diversification, had improved the fortunes of rural farmers as well as transformed agriculture into a potential catalyst for economic growth.The resilience that the country has built unwittingly against the COVID-19 pandemic in the area of rice production is a testament of the Anchor Borrowers Programme. Despite food prices making rapid climbs in the country owing to accelerating inflation in Africa’s most populous country, local rice prices were relatively stable when compared to other grains and this is largely due to the adequate supply.The increasing demand for rice in the country has also created investment opportunities for potential investors.“Lots of youths made investments in rice production owing to the border closure policy. Some invested in the aggregation of paddy for millers while others in the cultivation of the crop,” said a rice dealer who requested anonymity. He further explained that new farmers are going into rice production because of the huge market.“We are now consuming our rice and this is a market for farmers,” he said.For oil palm, the country’s narrative is gradually changing for good with the private sector tapping opportunities in its production to create wealth and boosting productivity amid government policies and the apex bank’s support to the sector.Palm oil producers benefited from the blacklisting of some 41 items including oil palm by the Central Bank of nigeria in 2016 and the fifteen-month border closure of 2019. Also, the Central Bank of nigeria supported smallholder oil palm farmers to boost local production.The apex bank through its intervention programmes said in April 2020 that it had disbursed a total of N34.3billion to major oil palm companies to support the industry with a plan to plant 100,000 hectares of palm oil trees by 2025, from 20,000 hectares in 2020.Through the interventions, nigeria has seen its crude palm oil production increase as new plantations spring up owing to expansion by existing players and support to smallholder farmers.Data from the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) shows nigeria’s oil palm fruits production has risen from 8.5million MT in 2016 to 10 million MT in 2019.Similarly, Malaysian Palm oil Council (MPOC) data shows that its exports to nigeria declined 20.6 percent year-on-year.nigeria’s crude palm oil (CPO) import from Malaysia declined from 95,621 metric tons (MT) in the first four months of 2020 to 75,948MT in the same period of 2021.The increase in production has helped reduce the country’s palm oil imports, drive local demand and forestall constant pressure on the Nigerian foreign exchange market.The upswing in the industry is an indication that Africa’s largest economy is making an attempt to take its proper place in the comity of global palm oil producers.Data from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that investment into the sector has been growing at an annual average of 82 percent since the government renewed support for agriculture.As a result, food production has been rising steadily and requests for FX for food importation have also reduced and this has contributed to the growth of the economy.The sector was one of the major sectors that contributed to bringing the country out of recession in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Nigerian agricultural sector grew by 2.17 percent in 2020 and contributed 23pecent to Gross Domestic Product for the period, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows.Growth in the agriculture sector was driven by output in crop production accounting for 91.4 percent of the overall nominal growth of the sector.However, despite the progress made in the country’s agricultural space, fundamental issues in the sector that would have stimulated robust growth and sustained progress are still lacking.Experts have attributed the slower growth and trade deficit in the sector to the inability of the government to address certain fundamental issues. They noted that the country can only drive robust growth in the sector when agricultural products become highly competitive.The need to increase mechanisation scale to meet the ever-increasing demand for food is emphasised as a prerequisite, before the country can talk about earning foreign exchange through the sector.It has also been said that the government must provide the needed infrastructures such as power and motorable roads to drive down production costs, effective and efficient rail transportation linking where the food is produced in the north and markets in the south as well as irrigation facilities to aid all-year farming.With all these in place, it is expected that nigeria’s agricultural products will be competitive in the market and as a result, importation will be largely discouraged.https://businessday.ng/features/article/cbns-shower-of-funds-in-agric-bears-fruits/"

To be honest,  I still can't fathom how people do it and this is the sole reason why I created this thread.The economy has been in shambles for the past 6 years of so he has been the president. And please don't tell me he inherited a bad economy from GEJ. Please don't.- Can we talk about security - Boko haram, bandits, kidnapping, Fulani herdsmen? Students in many parts of the country can't even go to school without the fear of being kidnapped and we have a government? SMH- What of respect for other arms of government like the judiciary and the legislature (which he has in his pocket by the way)? - Nepotism when giving out federal appointments (must every major appointment be a northerner)?- Using the army and just recently, the DSS against anyone who opposes him? (Bear in mind most of these people oppose him because of his own decisions and how he has chosen to turn a deaf ear to complaints of Nigerians)- Price of foodstuffs, fuel, and household items that affect the common Nigerian like you and me? - Crazy bleeped up decisions like banning Twitter, border closure, bleeped up FX policies, banning cryptocurrencies, and more. Gosh.- What about the ever-increasing exchange rate?- Healthcare? A president that has spent more than 200 days aboard for medical treatments alone, how do you think the healthcare in his country will be?- What of corruption? Once you join the APC, you automatically become a saint who can not be touched by the EFCC despite the fact that fighting corruption was the major thing Buhari campaigned with back in 2015.- Employment and poverty rate?The list goes on and on and on and in fact, if I start talking about the failures of this present government, Nairaland won't be enough.Anyways, let's be reasonable and keep tribalism and religious lines aside. if you still support Buhari in 2021, can you tell me why?

While all the customs concentrated on major routes, the bad guys were busy ferrying in weapons and food items via hidden routes. Anyone who was in owode during this time would confirm this.

241,,,"*IGR: WHY LAGOS LEADS ... THE ASIWAJU FOUNDATION & MASTER CLASS* - By Ray Ekpu.At long last the scales have fallen from their eyes and they can now see clearly, very clearly, that carrying handout bowls to Abuja is not the right way to prosperity. The Governors of the 35 states have now decided that they can go to Lagos and find out what the Lagos State government has done right or wrong in internal revenue generation (IGR). The internal revenue generating pilgrimage has been long overdue but because the oil money was flowing, the State Governors felt cool and thought of no need to expand the generation of revenue in their own states.The NNPC said recently that even though oil prices are going up, petrol import revenue is also going up because our four refineries are dead, stone dead. That means that petrol subsidy is back with vengeance. If petro; is to be consumed where there is no refinery, petrol must be imported. When it is imported all kinds of mago mago and wuru wuru may come into play.Now our Governors have realised, a little late, that what may be put in their bowls by Abuja every month may become meagre and more meagre by the day. So they then decided, as an ugly way out, that petrol can be sold for 400 naira a litre or something like that. They didn’t remember that the Labour fellows will snipe at their feet by grinding the economy to a halt with wild cat strikes.In any case, the amount of disposable income in most people’s pockets today is low, very, very low and if the price of petrol is raised astronomically the petrol attendants will be sleeping on duty with no customers to attend to. A few years ago when the price of petrol was raised I drove into one of the petrol stations to fill the tank of my car. When the attendant finished her job I did my own job too as evidence that our transaction had been successfully brought to a closure.The attendant told me: “Thank you, thank you, thank you.” I thought that one “Thank you” was enough for being paid for what was being bought and sold. When she exceeded that I knew that there was something very wrong or something very right. The curiosity of the reporter woke up in me and I asked why she was thanking me very profusely. She explained that most of the motorists she had been attending to were just telling to her “put for 300 naira, put for 400 naira” and that I was the first person that day to say fill the tank. I felt like Aliko Dangote for a few seconds. Now the Governors have realised that we are in a catch 22 situation and they may not get much revenue from oil takings.They have come to the happy place that they have avoided for many years. Now they are telling Lagos *“Teacher, teach us how you do it. For starters they must get this clear: none of them can make as much money as Lagos. Lagos is unique in many ways. Lagos has Tinubu's master plan. It has three airports, three seaports, several beaches, an array of banks, telecommunications and manufacturing companies, the biggest breweries, the biggest flour mills, four football stadia, several tertiary institutions, a thriving entertainment universe, high grade hotels, a vibrant night life – Lagos never sleeps – a major media hub, loads of highly trained human beings. It is also an exuberant economic and political vortex with exceptional vitality, perspicacity, creativity; a city that is constantly reinventing itself. Kaye Whiteman who published the book Lagos: A cultural and historical companion described it as the “true city of imagination” while the famous poet Odia Ofeimun extols it for its “citiness.” Lagos makes money from land, air and water*.Now, rail has come into the mix. Even though none of the 35 states can be like Lagos they can pick up a few lessons if they are ready to be diligent students of Tinubu's master plan. Let’s look at the IGR trajectory of Lagos: 1999 (14.6 billion), 2007 (83.06 billion), 2015 (276.6 billion), 2020 (418.99 billion). Those figures show an upward swing from 1999 to today. Last year, the closest was Rivers State with N117.19 billion while the second runner up was Delta at N59.73 billion. There are several reasons why most of the 35 states are not doing well in IGR.Some of the reasons include leadership battles between predecessors and successors. In one of the states in the south, a Science and Technology park established by a Governor was thoughtlessly abandoned by his hostile successor. Can you imagine? Who was hurt in the process? His government and his state. In Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is completing some of the projects initiated by his predecessor Ambode who waged a bitter battle against him. That shows decency on the part of the incumbent Governor. That shows focused leadership. That shows commitment to the public good. That shows broadmindedness. If you go to some of the states you will see many projects abandoned by successor-Governors who are fighting the shadows of their predecessors. That is small-mindedness, meanness, pettiness of the lowest rung. But that is the nature of our own brand of politics. Also the attitude of some public servants is a disincentive to prosperity of their states.A few years ago a Governor in one of the Southern States thought I knew experts in various fields and asked me to bring them to his state for a seminar on IGR. I submitted a proposal which he promptly minuted to someone for implementation. The proposal went missing for six months. The day the Governor showed his anger the proposal reappeared from its hiding hole.The next problem was the official asked to handle the proposal. He told me that the Governor had already approved consultants for IGR. I told him that the seminar was for experts in various fields to throw up various unconventional ideas that the consultants could turn into money. He did not budge. I went back to the Governor. Again, the Governor was angry and sent for him. When arrived at the Governor’s office and saw me there he was shaking like leaves in the wind. The Governor chewed him out and gave him a deadline to implement the project. He directed me to his Permanent Secretary, a lady who insisted that the lecture hall will have to be decorated. I asked her: Do you decorate lecture halls. She said “yes” I knew that corruption had just walked in on four legs.On the day of the seminar I told this lady that I learnt that the Governor who was to open the conference was receiving people who had come on a courtesy visit and that we should begin the lectures but will break when the Governor arrives. She told me that would be a breach of protocol and that we could do nothing until the Governor arrived. I ignored her and started proceedings.The Governor arrived when we were on the third lecture and he wasn’t angry with me. We stopped the lecture. He made his speech and declared the seminar open. When he left we continued. If I had allowed her that lady would have made her boss, the Governor, to keep the eminent people I had assembled to look at her boss as irresponsible or arrogant for keeping them waiting for hours even though he was the one that chose the time for the seminar. With people who think like that, there is a problem: wrong attitude.Every one of the 35 states must find out what can work for them because of diversity. Extreme religiosity is a problem that is hindering development in some of the states. Lagos has a large Muslim population and even when it was run by Governors who were Muslims, the sale of alcohol was not an issue. Some governments in the world impose what they call “sin taxes,” taxes on such items as alcohol, cigarettes, cigar and gambling. Instead of breaking millions of bottles of beer every year in such states as Kano.Why can’t they impose heavy taxes on such socially undesirable items. The advantages of that approach are three (a) they make money (b) they fight socially undesirable behaviour and they (c) they look good in a democracy. nigeria’s advancement has been significantly hampered by bad politics. There is a Dr Njoku whose vaccine was approved by the WHO some years ago but local politics killed it. There is a Nigerian doctor who had a patent approved for diabetes treatment but politics killed it. There is a professor at Obafemi Awolowo University who had the patent for pounded yam machine but politics and our lack of appreciation for innovation took it away. Awka, the capital of Anambra State is the automobile haven in West Africa. Why are they not getting the needed patronage by all the States in nigeria? Petty or ethnic politics is the answer.The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu says that technology is the new oil. Correct. He says the state is building the biggest technology hub in Africa to train start-ups that would develop tech solutions for technological advancement. “We are building a tech campus on a 22, 000 square metres of land in Yaba which we christen K.I.T.E. We are working with global brands in the technology space such as Google and Facebook to deliver the important technology hub.” Apart from building the technology the Lagos State Government supports start-ups with funding.Last year it spent 250 million naira on different tech start-ups in the State. Technology is what has kept Israel many kilometres ahead of its neighbours. In their book titled The Story of Israel’s Economic Miracle, Dan Senor and Saul Singer have explained how Israel has produced more start-up companies than Japan, India, Korea, Canada and the United Kingdom. And Israel’s population is only about 7.1 million and they have enemies on every side of their border.Their creativity, their innovation and their thrift have jointly saved them from extermination. Israel has become one of the prime incubators of technological innovation. Many states in nigeria lack innovation and the ability to get value from their comparative advantage. For many years nigeria has been exporting raw materials such as palm oil, palm kernels, piassava, coconut, cassava. Did anybody tell them not to process them and add value to them? Nobody. Oil just made us all lazy. Now we will begin to think. Let me make a few suggestions.We waste waste (garbage) in this country even though we can transform waste to wealth. The University of nigeria, Nsukka is generating electricity from garbage. Why can’t the states do the same thing with the garbage generated in their states? We send people to prison for minor offences. Why can’t we revise the laws and let those offences attract fines and manual labour? The Governor of Ondo State, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu has been canvassing for an approval for the cultivation of Indian hemp under some regulated arrangement. A lot of people are shooting down the idea without giving serious thoughts to the pros and cons of the proposal. New ideas are what can bring progress. Lagos is progressing because it is ready, has always been ready to embrace new ideas. States that remain in the past can never make significant progress. That is the most important lesson that Lagos offers!"

245,,,"By Kehinde AdeoyeEver since after the unfortunate outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, that was first reported from Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019, the world economy has been thrown into disarray. World powers including the United States went neck deep into recession. It was same story for other American and European countries. The global health crisis also took its toll on the African continent and Nigerian wasn’t left behind.All over the world, deaths were recorded and several homes were affected by loss of jobs, shelter and livelihood. Lockdown were subsequently initiated in every part of the world to limit the spread of the virus which perhaps was grossly felt in some places than others. But even at that, thus far, the coronavirus-related deaths worldwide has passed a grim milestone of 4 million.After the introduction of lockdown which made it difficult for people to go about their businesses. It got worse for artisans and business owners who made their living through daily sales unlike salary earners. Governments throughout the world encouraged citizens to stock up food items for the lockdown. At that time, it was uncertain when movements would resume. Most people had to withdraw their savings to feed their families.nigeria’s economy was shut down at the twilight of March 2020, as a result of this problem which halted all production activities, movements and major economic activities.  Some small and medium scale business owners with huge employees had to lay off their workers, downsize or close down the entire business because they couldn’t meet up with the monthly financial obligations towards their workers.The agricultural sector was one of the several sectors affected by the pandemic globally, because the lockdown was put in place during the planting season. Despite the fact that it was subsequently relaxed a little to enable farmers to cultivate, they had difficulties accessing farm inputs and transporting the same across the markets.Narrowing it down to nigeria now, we would recall that prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, clashes between farmers and herdsmen were rampant. That prompted heavy reduction in production of food crops especially in the northeastern parts of nigeria. Most farmers who have had terrible experiences with the clashes either stopped farming or reduced the capacity of farm production.The COVID-19 lockdown restricted the transportation of goods, especially food items, across the country. A ban on inter-state movement and farmers’ inability to cultivate their farmlands, amongst other processes, posed a challenge on food security in the country. So, it wasn’t unexpected that these unusual distortions of farming activities and agricultural business would shrink the supply of various farm produce, with attendant increase in prices of food items.A market survey by Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation indicates that  “Nigerians witnessed an average of 66.8% increase in the prices of food items between last year (2020) February, the month the first case of coronavirus was confirmed, and at March (2020), when the survey was conducted.Dataphyte’s analysis of the prices of foodstuffs across 13 states in the country, one of the most extensive market surveys in the country showed that the food price situation had contracted the purchasing power of citizens. The states sampled were Anambra, Benue, Enugu, Ebonyi, Abuja (the Federal Capital Territory, FCT), Kano, Kwara, Lagos, Niger, Ogun, Ondo, Oyo, and Sokoto states.“The price of beans and garri nearly doubled within the period under review. Beans rose from N1,457 to N2,883 per paint rubber, representing an estimated 98% (97.92%) increase. The cost of garri rose from N869 to N1,856 per paint rubber, an estimated 97% (97.27%) change. The price increases of these two staple foods were the highest in the last one year period of the coronavirus pandemic,” Dataphyte said.Garri is made from cassava, a tuber plant, which is one of the most important food crops in West Africa. nigeria produces about 250,000 tonnes of it annually. nigeria is also regarded as the largest producer of cassava in the world. Garri is either made into ‘eba’ or soaked to drink as flakes. It is often regarded as the ‘poor man’s food,’ in nigeria, because of its relatively low price and the ease of taking it as a snack without need of cooking, unlike most of the other food items.Dataphyte further disclosed in its report here.However, sustained violence and a general state of insecurity in the country, especially in the northeast of the country, could have contributed to the scarcity of the farm products and processed food items.But statista making a disclosure from its survey on the percentage change in prices of selected food products in nigeria 2021 said: “In May 2021, food prices in nigeria increased considerably compared to May 2020. Maize, gari (or garri), oil, and beans prices increased the most. In particular, the price of white gari grew by over 50 percent compared to the previous year, while the price of yellow maize grain added up to 51 percent more. Among all selected food products, no item recorded a decrease in price. In fact, nigeria is among the countries with the highest inflation rate in the world and recorded a fast growing CPI.”Other factors responsible for the food price surges include border closure, said to have contributed 4%. General Insecurity, terrorism, killings, kidnapping, farmers-herder clashes were also said to have directly contributed about 3% of the cause.Now, in a bid to reduce hunger and scarcity as well as cater for the welfare of Nigerians, especially the poor households, the Federal Government through the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs gave out tokens and distributed palliatives throughout the statesSince the intervention of the Federal Government (FG) to share palliatives and cash to the poorest of the poor had little effects, the FG saw the need to further address the state of the nation with the introduction of the Economic Sustainability Committee chaired by Vice President Osinbajo. This was created specifically to address the post Covid-19 issues affecting the economy.nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) was approved by the Federal Executive Council on June 24, 2020, as established by President Muhammadu Buhari on March 30, 2020. Chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the ESC comprised several Cabinet Ministers as well as the Group Managing Director of the NNPC and the Governor of the Central Bank of nigeria.While inaugurating the committee on the April 2, 2020, the Vice President noted that “what Mr President has asked us to do is to devise a strategy in order to be able to keep the economy going and also make provisions to ensure that we are able to retain jobs and indeed create more.”“We also need to develop the Nigerian economy in a way that we will even take advantage of the challenges of these times and convert those challenges to opportunities,” Prof Osinbajo said.Speaking further on the responsibilities of the committee, the Vice President said “what we will need to do is something that is bold, radical and one that our people can understand and buy into.“We must design a broad vision that takes into account how to implement a big plan inclusive of a focus on mass local productivity and mass employment.“The big plan of government is to find a way for us to be able to do mass housing, increase agricultural production, ensure massive local productivity by among several other options, increasing support to MSMEs, and majorly improve avenues to put more cash in the hands of our people and also make them productive,” the VP noted.After deliberations by the committee, the Vice President submitted its report for implementation on the 11th of june, 2020 with the theme “Bouncing Back”. The President reacting to the development appreciated the committee while tagging the plan a “National Plan.“I’m pleased to hear that the Economic Sustainability Committee consulted with all the National Economic Councils and the National Assembly, and I look forward to our continued partnership with one focus to implement what I consider a national plan,” the President noted.The Vice President said the Committee was motivated by President Buhari’s directive to come up with a plan that would to provide succour to Nigerians, taking into account the dangers posed to the economy by the global economic slowdown, which also resulted in a drastic fall in crude oil production and prices, with serious implications for government revenues and foreign exchange earningsSpeaking after receiving the ESC plan from the VP, President Buhari said the committee was established because “during these uncertain times, the government saw the need to act quickly and avert the worst; while government continues to seek ways of supporting businesses and industry. The President added that the administration is determined “to support business especially sectors facing difficulty as the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant socio-economic Covid-19,” while it focuses on implementing the recommendations of the national plan.The President stated that the recommendations in the plan would help in developing a truly competitive economy that can support our people and secure our future. He said “I congratulate the Economic Sustainability Committee for completing this critical national assignment in good time,” he added. He also commended Nigerians for their resilience in adapting to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the efforts of health workers whom he said, “continue to play critical role in keeping our country safe.”Prof. Osinbajo, still on the same issue added, “In other words, to create millions of new jobs, we need to focus on encouraging local production, local services, local innovation, and emphasize the use of local materials. nigeria and Nigerians can produce our food, build our houses and construct our roads, using local materials in all cases. If we must import, it must be to support local production. We have, therefore, recommended that we must carry out mass programmes that create jobs and utilise local materials.”A mass agricultural programme, mass housing programme, support for micro, small and medium enterprises, reduction in NAFDAC registration fees, survival fund, strengthening the social safety net are the proposed key projects among others were created to alleviate the problems.Continue reading here ���https://thedailyleaks.com/forces-behind-hike-in-food-prices-and-governments-interventions-in-nigeria-globally/"

SBM gathered reports from major food markets across the country and noted how people lamented devastating rising prices of food which have altered their normal daily living.The prices of most staple food items in a typical Nigerian home, including rice, beans, egg, garri, plantain, yam, beef,  palm oil, fish, pepper, tomatoes, onions, bread and groundnut oil,  have all surged.In Lagos, a housewife disclosed to SBM that the food allowance her husband provides could no longer sustain the family. She precisely complained about her failure to buy monthly food items, which now occurs every two weeks or save from the allowances while expenses keep increasing. A trader in Lagos’s Balogun Market was very specific as to fish, saying that the border closure affected his ability to supplement  his fish stock, forcing him to raise prices for the increasingly scarce stock he has.Most of those interviewed in the low socio-economic echelons admitted they could no longer afford three square meals but had one whole meal daily supplemented with snacks. Mrs Christiana, a Lagos housewife and entrepreneur disclosed she chose two-square meals daily, as allowances received can no longer afford her family decent three-meal days. Another respondent who is a wife and mother of two at Sango-Ota, Ogun State, lamented the rapid escalation of prices of commodities in the market at Sango-Ota. She explained how she last went to the market and ended up confused about what exactly to buy since “what N20,000 can but a few months back, today, N40,000 cannot afford the same.”The price of beans and garri in Sango-Ota rose by a significant 97.9%, which almost doubled within the period under review. Beans rose from N1,457 to N2,883 per four-litre paint rubber and garri saw a  price rise from N869 to N1,856 per paint rubber. According to her, the price increases of these two staple foods were the highest in the last one year.In Port Harcourt, a four-litre paint bucket of garri, which sold for N1,200  at the end of March, rose to N1,500 by June 2021, an increase of 25%.  In the same period, a paint bucket of beans, which sold for N1,500, now sells for N1600.Visits to various markets revealed that in all the markets except in Onitsha, Port Harcourt and Calabar Municipal markets, the cost of making a pot of Jollof rice has skyrocketed. The decline in Anambra, Rivers and Cross River states was as a result of a slight reduction in the cost of beef, onions and tomatoes.[url]http://saharareporters.com/2021/07/16/nigeria-ranks-98-among-107-countries-global-hunger-index[/url]Mynd44 Lalasticlala"

The contributing factors are enormous as emphasised in our previous reports; a combination of government and market failures.Restating the key drivers, insecurity, adverse weather conditions, lack of storage facilities, increased energy tariffs, land border closure policy and the Coronavirus Pandemic made critical impacts.This begs the question, how do 40.1% of Nigerians who were already below the poverty line before the Pandemic purchase food considering the exacerbating effect of the Coronavirus?SBM advised the federal government to reverse unnecessary fixation on domestic food production, and rather prioritise the availability of cheap food, both locally produced and imported, and providing the support everyone needs to produce or bring in food.It asked the federal government to remove the politicising of security and deal with it across nigeria, especially in food-producing areas of the country.SBM further said the federal government needs to look urgently into the storage and infrastructure around food preservation and transportation in the country.SBM warned that the prevalence of stunting in children under five increased to a 36.8 score from 36.2 in 2012 and the proportion of the undernourished in the population grew from 7.6 in 2012 to 12.6 in 2020. However, the prevalence of wasting in children under five (14.1 in 2012 to 6.8 in 2020) and the under-five mortality rate (13.0 in 2012 and12.0 in 2020) have both dropped.In the 2020 Global Hunger Index (GHI), nigeria ranks 98th out of the 107 countries, getting a GHI score of 29.2 out of a 100-point scale. This places nigeria at a hunger level that is considered serious.

257,,,"By Ifechukwu Nwobodo-AnyanwuWe will not be exaggerating if we call Ebonyi state the home of rice production in nigeria. What many do not know are the resilience and hardship that have kept this industry going since 1942, long before Ebonyi State was created in 1996. There are a group of local farmers who despite the countless obstacles they experience daily, have been changing the narratives and feeding this nation with healthier, locally produced rice for almost 8 decades. For this expose, we will refer to them as Abakaliki Rice Farmers.Abakaliki is the capital of Ebonyi State, southeast nigeria. The state is blessed with a near- perfect savannah and hydromorphic soil suitable for growing rice- a staple food that is consumed both locally and globally. However, rice farming did not come to Abakaliki as a business venture but as an answer to hunger during the Second World War. The state has the Colonial Department of Agriculture to thank for this innovation. At first, the indigenous farmers put up a lot of resistance to this new trend as it was believed that the cultivation of rice somehow impeded that of yam- a famous crop referred to as the king of all crops. When the farmers realized how easy it was to grow rice, they later tuned in and started growing rice alongside the foreigners and other Igbos from other states that came to Abakaliki to farm. Rice Associations sprang up with time and by 1960, they had started exporting to other states and countries like Ghana, Togo, etc. They did not just grow rice, they also became known as rice milling centre for the country. Other states milled the rice they had harvested at Abakaliki. It is important to note that these farmers have suffered and are suffering many setbacks as rice farming involves processes that could be made easier with mechanized farming. Clearing and ploughing of land are still done with local hoes, this affects the farmers and the quantity of production. The outburst of rice disease in 1970 and the brown leaf rice disease of 1981 could not stop them. Rice cultivation suffered setbacks in the 1990s when rice gall midge (an insect) attacked rice farms and made many farmers bankrupt.It is a paradox that in 2010, research showed that nigeria is both the largest producer of rice in West Africa and also the largest importer of the same product. During Goodluck Ebele Jonathan’s administration, the country spent N1 billion daily on rice importation. The reasons behind this anomaly are not far-fetched. Rice production involves clearing, ploughing, seed scattering, weeding, fertilization, harvesting, sickling, wiping, winnowing, parboiling, drying, milling and sieving. All of these processes when done with little or no mechanical input wearies the farmer and reduces the output.Another factor that militates against rice cultivation in Abakaliki is the issue of flooding. Rice requires a reasonable amount of rainfall to guarantee a good harvest. Excessive rain causes flooding making the rice crops sip water when submerged in floodwater for up to two weeks, they become too weak to carry the seeds. In the same vein, heavy rains cause the rice to fall flat to the ground. Also, when rainfall is not abundant in the area, the rice would lack water to sustain it and the plants will dry up. Once the plants go dry, the rice plant sheds its seeds prematurely. The answer to this is the provision of adequate irrigation facilities for the farmers.The closure of the border against rice importation and the increase in tariff of rice coming into nigeria by 70% was in the interest of the nation’s economy. Regrettably, the corruption virus that has eaten deep into our nation’s fabrics also contributed to the inflation of the prices of local rice. Rice smugglers have not given up and their activities undermine federal government efforts to boost local rice production. In 2018, 5 billion USD worth of goods including rice was smuggled into nigeria. An estimated volume of over 2 million metric tonnes of parboiled rice was smuggled into nigeria. The Buhari administration’s dream of self-sufficiency in rice production could still be fully realized if the grass root farmers are identified and their needs provided directly. Rice farmers must be identified, given subsidies like fertilizers and loans irrespective of their party affiliations. The Central Bank of nigeria must work with farmers as cooperatives and not necessarily disbursing funds to state governors.With the recent improvement in de-stoning and milling of rice, the consumption rate of local rice has improved tremendously, but we are still a long way from being truly self-sufficient. Road networks leading to rice farms should be constructed and new storage facilities erected. This rice planting month, we celebrate Abakaliki Rice Farmers for their efforts all these years despite changing policies by the government and discouraging patronage from the citizenryIfechukwu Nwobodo-Anyanwu. email: emelstephy@gmail.com"

Jamaican elders used to say, ""Black noh good"", and as an ardent Pan Africanist, i was resentful of that but I’ve come to see that they were right. Africans/blacks are possibly where they are today due to being as unpleasant, cruel and horrible as the rest of the world’s peoples’ but exceptionally back-stabbing types. And as long as nigeria refuses to face front, put Nigerians first (don’t built rail line to Niger Republic, don’t build road to Cameroon, lock the borders tighter) look after nigeria’s interest and forget Africa, nigeria will be pull down by a racist world and Africa helping them. Look at Dubai, if not for knowing how Africa secretly resents nigeria, would they act unfairly towards nigeria and expect applause? If nigeria were a country that harbours resentments would the Emirates go unpunished time and again after humiliating nigeria which further emboldens them? Nigerians benefit Dubai, Dubai does not befit nigeria."

295,,,"*Seme border: Group charges Amb Buratai to facilitate healthy trade relations, national security between nigeria/Benin Republic*... passes vote of confidence on nigeria’s envoy to the Benin Republicnigeria's Ambassador to the Benin Republic, Amb Tukur Buratai, has been tasked to swiftly hit the ground running, enhancing trade relations and trans-border security between both nations, especially around the Seme border.  Passing a vote of confidence on the former Chief of Army Staff, the nigeria First movement said Amb Buratai is tailor-made for the job owing to his vast experience in military and diplomacy. Lt. Gen Buratai (rtd) and immediate past Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Abayomi Olanisakin (rtd) were on Tuesday presented with letters of credence as envoys to Benin and Cameroon respectively. And according to nigeria First, Buratai's confirmation shows that President Muhammadu Buhari was satisfied with his performance as COAS, having effectively flushed out insurgents and other criminal elements from the North-East and other parts of the country. Speaking on behalf of the group at a press conference on Friday in Abuja, Secretary-General, Comrade Augustine Richard Adie, noted that Buratai's appointment is a welcome development at a time the nation's border is under several threats. Adie added that with Buratai, trade relations between the two countries will be strengthened more than ever, leading to more foreign exchange for nigeria.  Recalling his stint as Army chief, Adie hailed Buratai for a successful campaign against insurgency in the country which has translated to peace and security to several parts especially in the once-troubled North-EastHe, however, advised members of the opposition party and other disgruntled individuals to stop the campaign aimed to malign Buratai’s image. Expressing total confidence in his ability, the group called on all Nigerians to extend support for the country's new Ambassador to the Benin Republic. Read the full statement below: nigeria First, heartily congratulates Ambassador, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai (rtd) on his recent appointment. We are happy to finally acknowledged that ""the Best man for the job has finally arrived"".Knowing about the way Nigerians have continuously expressed their enraged feelings about the matters of insecurity in the country, ever since when Boko Haram insurgency has taken the country unaware since 2009 when they began a violent campaign in North-East nigeria, everyone now believes in every reason to tighten up our security portals.Having fought a good fight to subdue and weaken internal terrorism and banditry in the country, President Muhammadu Buhari took a great strategic move on this appointment because he was satisfied with your performance and your great knowledge of international diplomacy.Therefore, Mr President saw the need to expand frontiers in the war against insurgency in the country, which in our opinion culminated in the appointment of the former service chiefs as non-career ambassadors to galvanize the much needed regional support at addressing the threat posed by the Boko Haram insurgents.For the record, nigeria has never experienced a much peaceful time as compare to when Buratai was Chief of Army Staff since the rampage of Book Haram had begun.nigeria is still battling insurgency even with the change of Service Chiefs that most Nigerians had clamoured for. And was that the solution? Has that changed anything?Instead, the situation has remained stagnant and getting worse as some stipulated by many.The appointment of Ty Buratai is a welcome development in terms of the development of diplomacy and national security.His appointment at a time when nigeria’s border is under several threats is a wise decision made by the administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari.  This move is vital and strengthens trade relations between the two countries.Buratai is the ideal candidate for this position owing to his vast intellect and diplomatic skills. The current position to which he has been recently appointed must be handled delicately. It requires someone with profound intellect and experience. We are happy that Buratai has been chosen as the man for the job.This is a man that served the country as a military leader without a blemish on his entire career. This is the right reward for a man who has served his country diligently and to the best of his abilities. This is a man who has given his all to the nation and we have no doubt that he will do the same in his current position.However, despite the flawless record of this man, his appointment has been bathed with opprobrium by several individuals who believe that he is not fit for the job for several reasons best known to them. There have also been several claims that his appointment is all in a bid to protect him from prosecution for crimes wrongfully alleged against him. These, we believe are the evil efforts of several members of the opposition party and other disgruntled individuals to sully Buratai’s image. These individuals have failed to see the bigger picture but have instead chosen to allow politics and senseless sentiments to blindfold them. These individuals are only after their interest instead of national interest. nigeria is currently in a delicate situation presently. The country has been plagued by insecurity and corruption amongst others and senseless political propaganda should not be added to the list.Buratai’s appointment is a promising development as it has a lot of potential advantages, one of which is the fact that the former chief of Army Staff has a vast network of friends and acquaintances globally. This is a great boost in terms of diplomacy and will be very beneficial in his current position. Buratai has a lot of unique skills in his arsenals such as his vast wealth of experience as a war veteran, a peacekeeper, an administrator and his efficiency in maintaining order and stability in conflict-ridden areas around the country. These skills will be very vital when it comes to his orchestration of diplomatic relationships and strategy.Let us all not be quick to forget his successful campaign against insurgency in the country and how he managed to bring peace and security to several parts of the country especially in the northeast. During his reign as the chief of army staff, he moved his base to the forefront of the war where he managed to defeat and wipe out many terrorists especially the one hidden in the enclaves of the Sambisa forest. Instead of the fight against insecurity, those of us familiar with the dynamics and state of play in the international arena will see the wisdom behind his appointment. It is a wise move to involve the international community in the fight against terrorism and banditry by appointing an individual who is conversant with the necessities of nigeria and the various areas in which support is needed.It is well known that the trans-border security between nigeria and the Benin Republic is quite low and has been plagued by smugglers and bandits. Buratai’s experience when it comes to tackling insecurity is thus priceless in dealing with border security between nigeria and the Benin Republic. His diplomatic skills are also sure to improve trade relations between the two countries.Several businessmen and women have been clamouring over the closure of the nigeria-Benin Republic border and have explained how the border closure has affected their business. We can boldly say to you all that have faith in Buratai as all issues regarding the border closure and trade relations will soon be resolved. nigeria’s lost revenue to the Benin Republic has been a troubling issue to the country. It goes without saying that no nation can survive without its foreign exchange earnings and nigeria is in no way an exception. We are certain that the ambassador will employ his sagacity and diplomatic skills to see to the re-opening of the Nigerian-Benin Republic border as soon as possible.Buratai has been a loyal and patriotic servant to the people of nigeria. His records and portfolio are excellent. He boasts a lot of skills, expertise and experience. He made incredible contributions towards the establishment of the Nigerian Amry University which greatly improved pedagogic approaches towards tackling insurgency in the country. His leadership boosted the morale of the Nigerian army and greatly influenced the war against insurgency. The time he served as a service chief has been widely regarded as one of the most productive in the annals of the Nigerian army. Under his leadership, the Nigerian army was rated high as regards human rights compliance by various international bodies. This was achieved as a result of his establishment of human rights offices to address issues regarding human rights violations by officers. This is another example of the insight the man portrays.nigeria plays a strategic leadership role in Africa and the appointment of a man as sagacious and experienced as TY Buratai ensures that nigeria cements its place as the giants and leaders in the African continent. It is well known to all that nigeria is a country looked up to owing to its portfolio, thus, the appointment of Buratai as a representative in the Republic of Benin is a step in the right direction. It makes much strategic sense because we would be sure that Buratai would put his wealth of knowledge to bear, especially in addressing some of the issues of concern for the country regarding Boko Haram getting logistics support outside the country.Ambassador Tukur Buratai remains a great asset to our country because of his deep foresight on national security. He is also a military historian, and thus good that he has offered himself once again in service to the country. nigeria First expresses total confidence in Buratai as a model of patriotism and chauvinism. His many accomplishments are a testament to the fact that his appointment was the right decision by the current administration. We call on all Nigerians to extend their support to the newly appointed ambassador rather than greet his appointment with baseless criticisms. Let us also continue to provide our endless support to the current President of this great nation and his administration as they work tirelessly for the growth and development of nigeria.God Bless President Buhari, God Bless nigeria."

297,,,"How nigeria Manufactures Hunger~ Tosin Adeoti[b][/b] A few days back a Facebook friend shared an experience (1) whose variations I am hearing more and more these days: While in a local bukka, a young schoolboy of about 14 accosted him. It was in the evening and the boy pleaded with him to buy him food. The lad explained that he had not put anything in his mouth since the dawn of that day. Even though he is someone who pays no mind to random folks requesting for funds, it did jolt him that the boy wasn't asking for money but food. In fact, the boy wasn't asking him for a full meal, only that he gives him the leftover from what he was eating. Moved with compassion, he bought him a meal. As he looked at the boy lapping up his soup, he realized that sometimes the reward of the giver is in the joyful face of the receiver.Things are hard in this country.Another friend summed it up in the usual humorous way Nigerians couch their hardship (2),""Earlier today, I saw my neighbor offloading more than 4 bunches of plantain from his truck. I mean, I won't be surprised if EFCC and DSS trailed him because where una dey see this money!!""Things are hard in this country.Many times I am tempted to ask low-level workers how they are surviving the hike in food prices. A few times I asked, I got an earful. Sometimes I part with a few coins but in my heart, I know what I have given can only buy so much in the market and that they will be back to square one in a few days. It is not sustainable. THIS GALLOPING FOOD INFLATIONThe Tribune newspaper ran a piece this month about the hyperinflation in the prices of food items and household products across the country (3). They reported that a measure of pepper that would sell for N1,000 about three weeks back, now sells for N3,000. A big tuber of yam which sold for N1,200 weeks back, now sells for N2,500. Personally, I was shocked that a crate of egg my family used to buy for N600 now sells for N1,600.The food inflation is so dire that with a food inflation of 22.28% (4), nigeria has the 11th highest food inflation rate among 169 counties in the world (5), and the 5th in Africa. An NBS survey conducted in 2020 showed that 58% of Nigerians reduced their food consumption between July and December 2020 (6). I imagine it's worse now. I mentioned that I was shocked when I found out that my beloved egg has jumped 169% in 4 years. Perhaps I should not have been. Those who regularly follow my economic commentary online would be surprised to read that I was shocked. This I had predicted a while back.HOW DID WE GET HERE?To get at the heart of a problem it is important for the right questions to be asked. According to the World Bank (2019), the GDP per capita of nigeria is $2,230 while that of Pakistan is $1,284 (8 ). Going by these figures, an average Nigerian is 70% richer than a Pakistani. Don't switch off yet. Stay with me a while, please.I could have chosen any country but I chose Pakistan because of the similarity in population. Depending on where you look and how believable you find the figures (9), nigeria's population is estimated at 210 million while Pakistan's is estimated at 212 million; 2 million people more populated than nigeria. So compared to other countries, it's about the closest. Now, if you go to the World Poverty Clock (10) and check out the number of people in poverty in both countries you will be in for some surprises. nigeria has 86 million people in extreme poverty but Pakistan has 10 million people. Pakistan has 5% of its people living below $1.9 per day while nigeria has 41%.Look at the two data points - GDP per capital snd extreme poverty population - and what do you come up with? One talks about income - Nigerians earn more than Pakistanis - the other talks about cost - Pakistanis have a much better purchasing power. It simply means that $1.9 will buy more things in Pakistan than in nigeria. Nigerians are poor not primarily because they are not earning enough but because what they earn is buying less and less compared to people in other countries. When you hear that nigeria has the most people in extreme poverty in the world (11), it's because their earning power is reduced. If in 2015 you were earning N100k and you were in the habit of buying a big tuber of yam at N500, that's 0.5% of your salary. Now that it's N2500, if your salary stayed the same, you would need to spend 2.5% of your income to buy the same yam. Remembering that unemployment rate has jumped from 10% in 2015 to 33% in 2021 brings it further home, meaning that some who were earning 100k actually have no income right now. Looking at the former scenario, it's either you part with more of your salary for less of yam, buy less yam with the same money, or look for an alternative. A 2016 World Economic Forum article quoted a USDA survey saying that Nigerians spend the most on food (12). While the percentage of household income spent on food in Singapore is 6.7%, 9.6% in Ireland, 9.9% in Austria, 19% in South Africa, as at 2016 Nigerians spent 56% of their income on food - again, the highest in the world. On the other end, Pakistan has its people spending 41% of their income on food (13). Is it becoming clearer where our demons are coming from? Food prices is one of the major reasons why nigeria with a higher GDP per capita than Pakistan has more than 8 times the number of people in poverty. Now, put on your thinking cap: Faced with this data, as a policy maker in nigeria, if asked what to do to lift Nigerians out of poverty, what would be one of the first things on your mind? Good! Reducing the percentage of household income Nigerians spend on food. Creating jobs for Nigerians is praiseworthy. Increasing the income of Nigerians is good. However, if the price of food items keeps increasing then their income will be worth less and less. To buy a tuber of yam with the same 0.5% of his salary, the person earning 100k in 2015 would need to be earning 250k today. This is a core issue that should keep government officials awake at night. No matter what you do, you must never do things that will increase the already high food prices because it means that more and more people will be thrown into the poverty bracket.WHAT ARE THE PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS?Once you start from this point that food is absolutely essential to curing hunger and reducing poverty in the country, you will realize the folly of the many policies that has become a given in our country. I will list out a few:• Banning food itemsNo month passes by without nigeria banning or threatening to ban the importation of certain food items. In a piece I wrote a while back titled We Don't Have a Rice Problem (14), I laid out my argument regarding why the government's obsession with rice is misguided. Banning of food items may well be a good policy in certain circumstances but even for those situations a country has to ensure that it has put in place adequate measures to prevent the suffering of its people. If nigeria consumes, according to PwC (15), 6.9 million tons of rice, you cannot blanket ban importation when production capacity is only 3.7 million tons. If we will ban, the right environment to close the supply gap has to be put in place. Thrive Agric (16) reports that rice production is hampered by both production (low mechanization) and socioeconomic (lack of access to inputs) constraints making it difficult for the gap to be bridged. This is evidenced by the price of the commodity. A 50kg bag of milled rice which sold around N10,000 in 2015 now sells for N23,000 on the average, according to a BusinessDay report (17). In fact, there are reports that foreign rice is being bagged as local brands (18). It's deception galore.• Full border reopeningIn a November 2019 piece (19), I argued vehemently against the border closure. In it, I predicted that as long as the border remains shut, whether fully or partially, food inflation will continue to increase. Someone contacted me after he read the article and asked for advice on what he should do for his personal economy, I asked him to stockpile food items. I am not a soothsayer. I have only through reading realized the implications of certain actions and policies. And I am saying now that unless we revisit these policies the prices of food items will continue to increase. In fact, I na few months time people would wish they bought more at present prices. It’s a simple case of ‘those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat them”.Strangely, despite the evidence of poverty around us, the government is yet to fully open the borders. It's gotten to such a head that only five days ago, the World Bank again advocated (20) that nigeria fully reopen its land borders to trade so as to help slow nigeria’s accelerating inflation rate.In Closing...There are other solutions to the problem of food hunger including resolving the grave insecurity in the land and good management of the exchange rate, and this has to be done alongside things like facilitating imports of staple foods and medicine by removing them from the list of FX restrictions. On June 12, when President Buhari announced that his government has lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty (21), many of us know it could not be true based on the realities on ground. Again, referencing the World Poverty Clock, the number of people living in extreme poverty in nigeria in 2019 was 77.9 million or 39 per cent of the population. By 2020, the number of people living in extreme poverty had jumped to 84.8 million, representing 41% of the population. In other words, at least 7 million Nigerians have been thrown into poverty in the last 12 months alone. And the World Bank confirmed it last Tuesday when it said that the high inflation rate caused by rise in prices of goods and services pushed seven million Nigerians below the poverty line in 2020 (22). Data based on World Data Lab's global poverty model indicates that 4.2 people are currently slipping into poverty every minute in nigeria.When one consider that nigeria has the second highest burden of stunted children in the world, with a national prevalence rate of 32 percent of children under five and that an estimated 2 million children in nigeria suffer from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) (23), then one wonders why a national emergency has not been called on the food inflation in nigeria.For all it's worth, we need to start now. This is not a political issue, food availability is a survival issue."

COMStray bullet kills 18-year-old student as security operatives clash with suspected rice smugglers in Badagry.An SS3 student was killed during a clash between security operatives of the Joint border Patrol Team (JBPT) and suspected rice smugglers at Irosu village near Badagry, NaijaCover Reports.From The Information Gathered By NaijaCover, Alade Oba, 18, was hit by stray bullet and died on the spot during the clash with JBPT comprising Customs, Army and Immigration on Saturday, June 19. The JBPT, which was established in the aftermath of the border closure of August 2019, is yet to be disbanded.It was gathered that the JBPT were on routine patrol at Irosu community near Sawa check point around Owode-Apa border post in search of smuggled foreign rice, following a tip-off.Some aggrieved youths, however, confronted the operatives, vowing that on no account should any security agent be allowed to enter their domain to carry out the operation.""However, in the ensuing fracas, the operatives started shooting into the air. In the process, one Alade Oba, an SSS3 student of Kankon Secondary School, was hit by a stray bullet and died on the spot. This resulted into serious protest by the youths who mobilized and burn tyres, demanding for the release of Oba’s corpse,” a source at the scene told News Agency of nigeria.The unrest prompted the Commanding Officer of 243 Recce Battalion, Ibereko, Badagry, Col. Nicholas Rume, to lead his men to the area to contain what could have degenerated into further loss of lives.The deceased corpse was later released to the family for burial while soldiers were deployed to maintain peace in the area.Mr David Aladeotan, Chairman, National Youth Council of nigeria (NYCN) in Badagry West, who confirmed the incident said the deceased was on his way from coconut farm when he was hit by stray bullet and died immediately.""Despite the fact that elders and leaders of the community assured them that there was no smuggled rice in the village, they continued searching, but they did not get anything. So, they deliberately picked some motorcycles parked by some people; this resulted into confrontation between the officials and the motorcycle riders, when they were trying to get their bikes back,"" he said. ""The riders overpowered them and collected their motorcycles back, this made the JBPT to reinforce, blocked the roads, restricting people’s movement. Consequently, they started shooting sporadically into the air and around. The bullets hit two people immediately. One of the victims is a SS3 student of Kankon Senior Secondary School, who died on the spot, while the other hit on the leg was receiving treatment in hospital.""Confirming the incident to NaijaCover, the Public Relations Officer, Seme Customs Area Command, Abdullahi Hussiain said the security operatives were attacked by rice smugglers who were using bush paths in Irosu community.""The officials of JPBT blocked the bush paths and apprehended some motorcycles being used for smuggling rice. The smugglers went to mobilise about 150 people to attack the officials of JBPT, throwing stones and using other weapons,"" Hussain stated. ""It was when they made an attempt to burn one of the Hillux buses by the team that the officials were forced to shoot into the air to scare them away. It was during the shooting that a stray bullet hit one of the ring leaders. The allegation that the guy was coming from farm is a lie, he was among the smugglers and one of them,” he added. Hussiain said that the situation had been brought under control, adding that normalcy had returned to the area.See Photos As Obtained By NaijaCover Below:Source: FACEBOOK USER"

Weare a country that doesn’t havecommodity boards compared to whatwe have in Cote d’Ivoire and someother West African countries; howcan we feed ourselves?

305,,,"The World Bank says an estimated 7 million Nigerians may have been pushed into poverty due to rising prices alone — without considering the direct impacts of COVID-19.In its latest report, “nigeria Development Update: Resilience through Reforms,” released on Tuesday, the bank noted that high inflation rate is worsening poverty and depressing business activities in nigeria.The report came few days after President Muhammadu Buhari said his government had lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty in the last two years.“In the last two years, we lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty – farmers, small-scale traders, artisans, market women and the like,” Buhari said during a speech to commemorate the June 12 Democracy Day.AdvertisementHe said his administration is strongly committed to lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years.According to the report, high inflation will frustrate economic recovery and erode households’ purchasing power, which will increase both the poverty rate and the number of people living below the poverty line.The World Bank said the inflationary pressure is tied to unfavourable weather, insecurity and conflict in food-producing areas, COVID-19 pandemic, trade restrictions and border closure, foreign currency restrictions, and nigeria’s exchange rate management.“The impact of higher inflation is severe. In 2020, rising prices alone — even without incorporating the direct impacts of COVID-19 on welfare — may have pushed an estimated 7 million Nigerians into poverty,” the report said.“In 2020, nigeria’s inflation rate was the seventh highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, but by the end of 2021, it is expected to rise to fifth highest, behind only Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Sudan, and Angola.“Inflationary pressures are expected to persist for the next six months, and for 2021, inflation is expected to exceed 16 percent.“In 2021 elevated inflation rates are expected to further exacerbate poverty and dampen growth. High inflation is expected to frustrate nigeria’s economic recovery and erode the purchasing power of households, which will increase both the poverty rate and the number of people living below the poverty line.”Macro Hernandez, World Bank’s lead economist for nigeria, during a presentation of the report in Abuja, said over 11 million more Nigerians are expected to lose their jobs due to the high inflation rate. On economic growth, the Bank projected that nigeria’s performance in 2021 would be below the averages for Sub-Saharan Africa and oil-producing countries.It said by the end of 2021, nigeria’s gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to approach its 2010 level, thereby reversing a full decade of economic growth.The World Bank further said if the federal government fails to sustain recent macroeconomic and structural reforms, the pace of economic recovery will slow, and GDP growth could be just 1.1 percent in 2021.In May, the consumer price index (CPI), which measures the rate of change in prices of goods and services, dropped to 17.93 percent from 18.12 in April.According to the ‘Consumer Price Index Report’, released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), on Tuesday, food inflation also reduced to 22.28 percent in May from 22.72 in April.Despite the drop, the inflation rate is still above the band of 6% to 9% set by the Central Bank of nigeria (CBN).https://www.thecable.ng/world-bank-high-prices-pushed-7m-nigerians-into-poverty-in-2020"

The border wasn't closed to encourage local rice production, it was closed to stiffle imports through the very cheaper Benin ports-same reason nigeria refuses to endorse the African free trade pact.Yes local rice is being produced massively today, but it started even before Buhari came to power- the construction of grain reserves in zones across the country and mechanization. Today a bag of rice has gone up to 200 % from 2014-and being the most staple food in nigeria,it's causing unbridled hardeship and hunger.- China is the world's biggest producer of rice, but the are also the world's biggest importer of rice.

361,,,"READ ME PLEASE!!!Nigerians To Pay More For Imported Vehicles From June 1Hike in terminal handling charges move businesses to neighbouring countries• Dealers lament rising cost, low patronage for used vehicles• This is a ploy to discourage vehicles importation, stakeholders allegeBeginning from June 1, 2021, Nigerians with a low budget would be unable to purchase cars while those with a high budget will pay double, as terminal operators have announced a 50 per cent increase in terminal handling charges.Two Roll On Roll Off (RORO) terminals at the Tin Can Island Port, Ports and Terminal Multipurpose Limited (PTML) as well as Five Star Logistics Terminal had two weeks ago announced an increase in their terminal handling charges by 50 per cent.According to the circular released by both terminal operators, the increment is expected to take effect from Tuesday next week. However, the terminals have blamed the increment on inflation and huge operational cost due to the nature of Nigerian ports, among others.In the circular by PTML, one of the biggest vehicle terminal in nigeria, it states: “PTML would like to bring to the attention of its esteemed customers that the dramatic surge in inflation in 2020 and 2021, as well as the ever-increasing operational expenses incurred because of the particularly challenging port operational environment, which has had a huge impact on the company’s direct cost. PTML tariff has not been adjusted for a number of years now, and it has become impossible for the terminal to provide the same level of service as current prices.”nigeria recorded a total sum of N1.28 trillion as of the value of ‘used vehicles,’ popularly known as Tokunbo, and motorcycles imported in one year (Q3 2019 – Q2 2020), showing an increase of 42 per cent, compared to N899 billion recorded in the corresponding period (Q3 2018 – Q2 2019).Despite the revised import duty tariff for transport vehicles, which was announced by the government in January, car dealers are still faced with dismal patronage because of the poor economic situation of the country.The rise in import tariff generally is taking a heavy toll on businesses and the cost of goods and services according to the nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS). According to the report gleaned from the NBS website, imports in nigeria decreased to N1,759,720.29 in December from N2,397,223.91 in November of 2020.Under Nigerian law, tax is charged at 7.5 per cent of the value of the taxable goods and services, known as Value Added Tax (VAT). At the moment, import duty varies from 5 per cent to 60 per cent, averaging 12 per cent but all imports are also subject to a 7 per cent port surcharge and a 5 per cent VAT.Though the Federal Government had announced a slash in import duties for tractors, transport vehicles, among others to cushion current socio-economic conditions in the country, this has not had any positive effect on the operating environment as importers say they still pay huge charges.Also, the slash on import duties in the 2020 Finance Bill is not yet in force. Though the law became effective on January 1, 2021, the lowered levy has not been implemented.MEANWHILE, importers, car dealers and freight forwarders have kicked against the 50 per cent increase in the terminal handling charges, saying the development would heighten inflation.They told The Guardian that the development will further worsen the economy, which is still grappling with aftershocks of two recessions while driving importers and investors to patronise neighbouring countries.Public Relations Officer of the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) at PTML Terminal, Ayokunle Sulaiman, while giving a breakdown of the PTML terminal increased charges, lamented that terminal handling, delivery, documentation and demurrage charges have all been increased.He said: “There has been a 50 per cent increase in the charges including terminal documentation. For vehicles, terminal documentation was previously N10,000, it has now been increased to N15,000. Terminal handling charges and terminal delivery charges are the core aspects of the job, all other ones like demurrage are avoidable.”Speaking on the Five Star Logistics Terminal increased charges, Sulaiman said: “For SUVs, we were paying N21,000 as terminal handling charges, now it has been increased to N33,000. For the same SUV, we were paying N3,600 as terminal delivery charges but it has been reviewed upwards to N7,500.”Sulaiman, however, said that there was no consultation before the terminal operators came up with the hike. Speaking on whether the charges were justifiable, given the explanation of terminals, Sulaiman said the terminal operators were supposed to inform stakeholders before increasing their charges.“If they were talking about increasing staff salary or employing more hands to enhance efficiency, we would be able to analyse it, we are humans, but you cannot just increase charges without giving us anything in form of efficiency,” he lamented.The Manager, Client Services, Inspired Cars, Iwayeye Olatunji, said car dealers are having a tough time with car sales. He said the hike would affect car businesses, as buyers would not be able to buy cars beyond their budget.“I bought a Nigerian used car for N3.7 million, which under the normal circumstance is not supposed to be more than N3.2 million. With this, I cannot sell this car for less and people would not want to buy. Somebody that budgets to buy a car for N3 million and by the time he gets to the car shop, he sees it for N4 million, the person will not be able to buy and this will affect our business, which is based on turnover,” he lamented.The car dealer said prices of vehicles have risen by more than 15 per cent in a 12-month period. When asked about how government policy was affecting his business, he said: “Due to border closure, cars stopped coming from the borders, which made the prices of available ones go up.”The dealer added that about this time last year, a used Toyota Corolla (2005 model) sold for N1.2 million but the same car currently sells for about N1.6 million; while models like the 2008 version went from a little over N2 million last year to just over N3 million now.The Manager, Client Services, Inspired Cars, Iwayeye Olatunji, said car dealers are having a tough time with sales as patronage has been consistently low this year, compared to the pre-COVID-19 period due to prevailing economic challenges that have affected consumers purchasing power. He added that government policy has made it expensive to bring vehicles into the country.Deputy National President, Air Logistics, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Dr Segun Musa, said the economic situation in the country is critical such that people are struggling to survive due to high inflation and government policies. Musa lamented that terminal operators are cashing in at the ports due to the government’s unfavorable policies.He said 50 per cent of terminal operators’ charges are from storage cost, which he blamed on the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) for making containers stay at the port for 30 to 40 days, instead of seven working days. He said all these would affect consumers, as businesses cannot be stopped from increasing their charges.The National President, African Association of Professional Freight Forwarders and Logistics of nigeria (APFFLON), Frank Ogunojemite, said while the economy is still reeling from the effect of COVID-19, the reason given by the terminal operators does not justify the increased handling charges.Ogunojemite said the increment will leave a huge effect on the economy as prices of commodities would go high with the low purchasing power of the people.MEANWHILE, the Nigerian Shippers’ Council has promised to resist any form of increment that would affect businesses. When The Guardian contacted the Executive Secretary of Nigerian Shippers’ Council, Hassan Bello, he said terminal operators have not increased their charges in a long time due to interventions by the council.He added that having received the letter from the two-terminal operators on the proposed increase in handling charges, the council would not allow any increase at this time, which is why the council will engage stakeholders and the terminal operators on the issue."

Such recklessness partly explains why the Cedi keeps depreciating. It's good to know why. nigeria's economy is suffering bitterly due to bad policies of the present president. The border closure explains a lot of things. Peace.

369,,,"• Hike in terminal handling charges move businesses to neighbouring countries• Dealers lament rising cost, low patronage for used vehicles• This is a ploy to discourage vehicles importation, stakeholders allegeBeginning from June 1, 2021, Nigerians with a low budget would be unable to purchase cars while those with a high budget will pay double, as terminal operators have announced a 50 per cent increase in terminal handling charges.Two Roll On Roll Off (RORO) terminals at the Tin Can Island Port, Ports and Terminal Multipurpose Limited (PTML) as well as Five Star Logistics Terminal had two weeks ago announced an increase in their terminal handling charges by 50 per cent.According to the circular released by both terminal operators, the increment is expected to take effect from Tuesday next week. However, the terminals have blamed the increment on inflation and huge operational cost due to the nature of Nigerian ports, among others.In the circular by PTML, one of the biggest vehicle terminal in nigeria, it states: “PTML would like to bring to the attention of its esteemed customers that the dramatic surge in inflation in 2020 and 2021, as well as the ever-increasing operational expenses incurred because of the particularly challenging port operational environment, which has had a huge impact on the company’s direct cost. PTML tariff has not been adjusted for a number of years now, and it has become impossible for the terminal to provide the same level of service as current prices.”nigeria recorded a total sum of N1.28 trillion as of the value of ‘used vehicles,’ popularly known as Tokunbo, and motorcycles imported in one year (Q3 2019 – Q2 2020), showing an increase of 42 per cent, compared to N899 billion recorded in the corresponding period (Q3 2018 – Q2 2019).Despite the revised import duty tariff for transport vehicles, which was announced by the government in January, car dealers are still faced with dismal patronage because of the poor economic situation of the country.The rise in import tariff generally is taking a heavy toll on businesses and the cost of goods and services according to the nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS). According to the report gleaned from the NBS website, imports in nigeria decreased to N1,759,720.29 in December from N2,397,223.91 in November of 2020.Under Nigerian law, tax is charged at 7.5 per cent of the value of the taxable goods and services, known as Value Added Tax (VAT). At the moment, import duty varies from 5 per cent to 60 per cent, averaging 12 per cent but all imports are also subject to a 7 per cent port surcharge and a 5 per cent VAT.Though the Federal Government had announced a slash in import duties for tractors, transport vehicles, among others to cushion current socio-economic conditions in the country, this has not had any positive effect on the operating environment as importers say they still pay huge charges.Also, the slash on import duties in the 2020 Finance Bill is not yet in force. Though the law became effective on January 1, 2021, the lowered levy has not been implemented.MEANWHILE, importers, car dealers and freight forwarders have kicked against the 50 per cent increase in the terminal handling charges, saying the development would heighten inflation.They told The Guardian that the development will further worsen the economy, which is still grappling with aftershocks of two recessions while driving importers and investors to patronise neighbouring countries.Public Relations Officer of the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) at PTML Terminal, Ayokunle Sulaiman, while giving a breakdown of the PTML terminal increased charges, lamented that terminal handling, delivery, documentation and demurrage charges have all been increased.He said: “There has been a 50 per cent increase in the charges including terminal documentation. For vehicles, terminal documentation was previously N10,000, it has now been increased to N15,000. Terminal handling charges and terminal delivery charges are the core aspects of the job, all other ones like demurrage are avoidable.”Speaking on the Five Star Logistics Terminal increased charges, Sulaiman said: “For SUVs, we were paying N21,000 as terminal handling charges, now it has been increased to N33,000. For the same SUV, we were paying N3,600 as terminal delivery charges but it has been reviewed upwards to N7,500.”Sulaiman, however, said that there was no consultation before the terminal operators came up with the hike. Speaking on whether the charges were justifiable, given the explanation of terminals, Sulaiman said the terminal operators were supposed to inform stakeholders before increasing their charges.“If they were talking about increasing staff salary or employing more hands to enhance efficiency, we would be able to analyse it, we are humans, but you cannot just increase charges without giving us anything in form of efficiency,” he lamented.The Manager, Client Services, Inspired Cars, Iwayeye Olatunji, said car dealers are having a tough time with car sales. He said the hike would affect car businesses, as buyers would not be able to buy cars beyond their budget.“I bought a Nigerian used car for N3.7 million, which under the normal circumstance is not supposed to be more than N3.2 million. With this, I cannot sell this car for less and people would not want to buy. Somebody that budgets to buy a car for N3 million and by the time he gets to the car shop, he sees it for N4 million, the person will not be able to buy and this will affect our business, which is based on turnover,” he lamented.The car dealer said prices of vehicles have risen by more than 15 per cent in a 12-month period. When asked about how government policy was affecting his business, he said: “Due to border closure, cars stopped coming from the borders, which made the prices of available ones go up.”The dealer added that about this time last year, a used Toyota Corolla (2005 model) sold for N1.2 million but the same car currently sells for about N1.6 million; while models like the 2008 version went from a little over N2 million last year to just over N3 million now.The Manager, Client Services, Inspired Cars, Iwayeye Olatunji, said car dealers are having a tough time with sales as patronage has been consistently low this year, compared to the pre-COVID-19 period due to prevailing economic challenges that have affected consumers purchasing power. He added that government policy has made it expensive to bring vehicles into the country.Deputy National President, Air Logistics, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Dr Segun Musa, said the economic situation in the country is critical such that people are struggling to survive due to high inflation and government policies. Musa lamented that terminal operators are cashing in at the ports due to the government’s unfavorable policies.He said 50 per cent of terminal operators’ charges are from storage cost, which he blamed on the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) for making containers stay at the port for 30 to 40 days, instead of seven working days. He said all these would affect consumers, as businesses cannot be stopped from increasing their charges.The National President, African Association of Professional Freight Forwarders and Logistics of nigeria (APFFLON), Frank Ogunojemite, said while the economy is still reeling from the effect of COVID-19, the reason given by the terminal operators does not justify the increased handling charges.Ogunojemite said the increment will leave a huge effect on the economy as prices of commodities would go high with the low purchasing power of the people.MEANWHILE, the Nigerian Shippers’ Council has promised to resist any form of increment that would affect businesses. When The Guardian contacted the Executive Secretary of Nigerian Shippers’ Council, Hassan Bello, he said terminal operators have not increased their charges in a long time due to interventions by the council.He added that having received the letter from the two-terminal operators on the proposed increase in handling charges, the council would not allow any increase at this time, which is why the council will engage stakeholders and the terminal operators on the issue.https://m.guardian.ng/news/nigerians-to-pay-more-for-imported-vehicles-from-june-1/"

371,,,"IT was past noon – lunch time – but there was only one customer at the bukka. Loretta Eze, the proprietor, surveyed the busy street as she stood by the entrance of her restaurant located by the corner of a street in the Wuse 2 area of Abuja, nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory. A number of girls in yellow shirts, who worked as attendants in the restaurant, were hanging around waiting for the solitary customer to finish his meal.“It was not always like this,” Loretta told The ICIR‘s correspondent, who visited the restaurant while investigating the impact of rising prices of foodstuffs on the preparation and consumption of food, especially jollof rice.“Food items are very expensive these days and the situation is very hard for those of us that are into catering and food business. Things are hard and as a result, we are not getting as many customers as in the past when things were cheaper,” Loretta added.Higher cost of foodstuffs has forced restaurants, including roadside bukkas and ‘Mama put‘ joints, to increase the prices of different dishes on their menu and Loretta observed that the development had, in turn, forced some customers to stay away because they could not afford meals as in the past.Loretta’s observations and concerns mirrored the findings in the SBM Jollof Index report for the first quarter of 2021.The SBM Jollof Index, developed by SBM Intel, an Africa-focused research firm, simplified the appreciation of food inflationary trends using a common delicacy that most Nigerian households enjoy – jollof rice.Across nigeria’s six geopolitical zones, SBM collects data on the most common ingredients that go into cooking jollof rice in 13 markets on a monthly basis except for December, due to the seasonal spikes caused by Yuletide celebrations. From the prices collated, the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for a family of five or six is averaged and used as a proxy for measuring food inflation across the country.The commodities that make up the Jollof Index include rice, curry, thyme, seasoning, groundnut oil, chicken/turkey (poultry), beef, pepper, tomatoes, salt and onions.The SBM Index is published three times a year – at the end of the first three quarters. Data from October and November are reflected in the Quarter 1 Jollof Index of the following year.Cost of making pot of jollof rice rose between March 2020 and March 2021According to the latest SBM Jollof Index report, the average cost of making a pot of jollof rice rose by 7.8 per cent between March 2020 and March 2021.The sharp spike in the cost of preparing the delicacy was attributed to a number of events which impacted on food prices. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown from March to May 2020, the border closure and foreign exchange restrictions in August 2020 were worsened by a sharp hike in energy tariffs by September of that year.The situation was further compounded by the the #EndSARS protests, as well as the food blockade imposed by northern traders on the southern part of the country, which disrupted agricultural supply chain and the movement of people and goods.The reopening of land borders in December 2020 did not result in a significant drop in the cost of food items – the price of a bag of rice only dropped slightly by a margin of N1000 to N3000 depending on the market but that did not translate into a drop in the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for the majority of Nigerians who buy from retailers.

399,,,"Security personnel deployed to man key Nigerian land borders have not been paid their mandatory allowance for 10 months, multiple sources involved in the operation told Daily Trust.An inter-agency operation tagged Joint border Drill Operation was jointly piloted by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) to ensure total compliance with the ban on movements along the border routes.Hundreds of personnel were drawn from the NCS, Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), police, Department of State Service (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), and the military, to form the border-manning teams.Though the borders were reopened in December 2020, the operatives were retained and redesigned to continue surveillance and counter-smuggling. The codename for the operation was changed to Joint border Patrol.Comptroller General of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), retired Col. Hameed Ali, confirmed the change of status and expectations from the operation while speaking in February.“We just set up a joint border patrol. It is an offshoot of the joint border drill, which was the operation we launched to close our borders,” Ali said.In addition to other responsibilities, the operatives were tasked to stop the importation of illegal arms and contraband goods as part of efforts to address rising security challenges while at the same time boosting local production of assorted food items like rice, oil, among others.The non-payment of the Duty Travel Allowance (DTA) for a long period is affecting morale of officers and threatening a key security operation of the country, security sources familiar with happenings said.Located at the extreme inner corner of the Gulf of Guinea on the west coast of Africa, nigeria occupies an area of 923,768 sq. km (356,669 sq mi), extending 1,127 km (700 mi) East to West and 1,046 km (650 mi) North to South. It is bordered by Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Benin, with a total boundary length of 4,900 km (3,045 mi), of which 853 km (530 mi) is coastline.The deployed officers are expected to contain smuggling and protect the territorial integrity of the country which is largely porous.Some of the affected personnel who spoke with our correspondents on the condition of anonymity for fear of victimisation, said months of unpaid allowances had rendered them all covered in debts and unable to meet up obligations to hoteliers, landlords and food vendors.Besides low morale, officers involved in the exercise lamented that the government’s inability to meet up with its obligation is affecting the operation as it was becoming increasingly difficult to enforce discipline and ensure accountability in the line of duty.The owed allowances were meant to cater for accommodation and feeding of the personnel who were deployed specifically to man the country’s borders following the closure of the land borders in August 2019.The federal government, through the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, had justified the closure of the land borders at the time, which she said will help the government address the proliferation of arms and influx of other contrabands.The security operatives were deployed to key towns affected by the border closure including Idi-iroko, Seme, Jibia, Kamba, Kongolom, Maigatari and Illela.The entitlements“Like with all special operations, we were posted from different areas to join this new operation and that was why we were entitled to DTA,” one customs officer said.The deployed operatives were placed on a daily allowance of N12, 000 for officers and N6,000 for junior ranks.While payments were made for the first few months of the operations, largely in arrears of two to three months, it became prolonged later with personnel having to wait for months before getting anything.Last year, after a long delay, arrears for four months was paid. However, since May last year, not a dime was paid to the personnel in the name of the allowances.Sources at the customs and ONSA told our reporter that the delay was being caused by the Federal Ministry of Finance, which has the mandate of funds releases.“The office in charge of that operation at ONSA has written nothing less than three letters to the Ministry of Finance on this issue but they are yet to oblige,” said one source who craved for anonymity as he has no permission to speak.Dire conditionSome operatives who spoke on the condition of anonymity lamented that they have been neglected despite the enormous responsibility placed on them.“Morale is low because there is no motivation, which is very important for the success of any operation,” a unit commander involved in the operation told one of our reporters.He said the personnel involved in the operation are being “made vulnerable to compromise”, with many of them owing hoteliers and giving out personal belongings as collateral.“Our people are sacrificing. A number of our people have been killed either by smugglers or insurgents yet we have made huge recoveries all over the place. But with this nonchalant attitude, morale is honestly diving,” the source said.He explained that it was becoming increasingly difficult to enforce discipline as men often challenge their superiors or justify their acts of compromise.“The low morale is also breeding insubordination as enforcement of discipline is becoming very tough. You will ask your men to do something but they will be very lethargic about it or even reject it outright. This is dangerous for the success of the operation.”With the dangers insecure borders pose to nigeria’s security as major entry points of light arms, a senior security source familiar with the operation lamented that toying with the welfare of the men may have a dire consequence on nigeria’s security.Finance ministry, Customs shiftyThe Federal Ministry of Finance and the Customs appeared to be shifting roles over the unpaid allowances.When contacted on the delay in paying the border operatives their entitlements, Yunusa Tanko, who is the Special Adviser, Media and Communications to the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, said the issue was purely a customs matter.“Please, I don’t understand this enquiry honestly. Did customs tell you their money is released and that of the patrol team held back?“This is purely a custom issue not ministry of finance so direct your enquiry to the proper channel/agency.”Contacted, NCS spokesman, Joseph Attah, said he was not aware of the issue.He, however, noted that customs has been at the fore of the operation and had provided all the required needs for the operatives to ensure high morale.It’s dangerous to toy with securityA security expert, Salihu Bakhari, said the federal government must always fulfil its own part of the obligation to discourage security operatives from compromising themselves.“You see, most of the operatives deployed for such exercise were brought together from different places. They left their families behind in order to protect the territorial integrity of the country.“I know that most VIPs especially politicians and chief executives of agencies collect their allowances long before they travel…It is therefore very sad to hear that security operatives who put their lives on the line are neglected.“This attitude makes them prone to corruption because they are easily compromised by high profile smugglers who would give them a lot of money to have their way.“There is a strong correlation between the infiltration of illegal arms and our porous borders. The federal government and the frontline state governments must come together and fund border security,” he said.https://dailytrust.com/10-month-pay-delay-threatens-border-security-operations"

It may have slowed some legal importation, but simply boosted illegal importation and killed legal exports, and fostered another Dangote sweetener.We are all aware of nigeria's problems, the smuggling in of foreign rice and all that, and the excessive importation of things we should be able to manufacture at home and the effect on the naira, etc.But you can't force the changes you want by cutting off legal trade with your neighbours in unilateral violation of an international agreement - that doesn't paint you in the best light, the best way to achieve your goal is to seek to provide favourable conditions at home for businesses to thrive.And you also need to realise that nigeria also needs its neighbours too - it is not yet self-sufficient. We might be able to be self-sufficient in food yes, but in other areas, not yet. Follow the news - recent trends show that Ghana is slowly but surely taking over what should be our position as the centre of everything in west Africa, from being its airline hub down to MNCs moving there. The more we continue to show ourselves as an unreliable country which doesn't live up to its agreements and suchlike, the less likely we are to attract more foreign investment, the more likely we are to lose what investment we already have, and for those who think that companies pulling out of the Nigerian manufacturing scene is no big deal - take a look at the official unemployment figures (which are bad enough, but should generally be multiplied by a factor of at least 1.5 and above to give a true picture). A fairly competent government would be scrambling to find out exactly why a major concern like Unilever (and Nestle too) took such drastic action and instead of further exacerbating the situation (""Oya, if una like, make una go now) would be moving heaven and earth to do what it can to change or prevent such a situation, not further alarming business with nonsense like border closures."

419,,,"The average cost of preparing a pot of jollof rice in nigeria increased by 7.8% between March 2020 and March 2021. An analysis shows that the most expensive place to cook Jollof rice in nigeria is Wuse, Abuja.This is according to the SBM Jollof index Q1 2021 report, published by SB Morgen. The Jollof index is a composite index that tracks the prices of the main ingredients used to prepare a pot of one of nigeria’s primary delicacies – Jollof rice, for a family of six. This meal was selected because it has the near unrivalled distinction of being a delicacy in every part of the country.In Abuja, food production is mainly undertaken by its neighbouring states Benue, Kaduna, Kogi and Niger, all of which have seen several attacks in the past few years, showing a decline in that dimension.The report revealed that the cost of making a pot of jollof rice is highest in Wuse, Abuja.Although food distribution has not been affected and unemployment rates are over 40%, but being the administrative headquarters of the government and most international NGOs, outreaches and food distribution are common.“In all the states surveyed, out of a score of 50, the combined score ranged from 18-27 which shows a general decline in entitlements across the states and similar levels of severity. While Bauchi has a higher chance of getting food insecure, the other states are slightly above the borderline, showing a medium decline in their entitlement (ability to get food).The average cost of making a pot of jollof rice in nigeria rose by 7.8% between March 2020 and March 2021. This is contained in the SBM Jollof index report for Q1 2021, published by SB Morgen.According to the report, the increase was caused by the prolonged border closure, increased energy tariffs, exchange rate volatility, coronavirus pandemic, and the restrictions of forex for the importation of items, largely due to falling oil prices.Key Highlights of the Jollof Index - Specifically, the average cost of making a pot of jollof rice in nigeria increased from N7,167 recorded in Q4 2020 to N7400 in the first quarter of 2021. representing a 3.24% quarter-on-quarter increase. - The cost of making a pot of rice is most costly in Wuse and least costly at Awka. The report, however, suggests that the disparity could be a result of operational costs rather than the actual cost of commodities. - While it is possible for people in Awka to substitute buying some of the commodities with products from their subsistence agriculture, the same is not possible in Wuse, largely because of its very urban nature. - The high exchange rate of N410/$1 to N475/$1 in the parallel market also adversely affected the price of jollof rice in the country as tomato puree, rice, turkey, and seasoning are affected by the exchange rates. - Also, flooding destroyed several hectares of rice farms across the country. The report stated that up to 500,000 hectares of rice farms were destroyed in Kebbi State alone. - The price of turkey has increased as a result of increased electricity tariffs which has forced increases in cold room costs.According to the SBM Jollof report, “Our interviews with traders shows that transportation costs have not reduced since they were increased during the introduction of the COVID-19 protocols. One of the traders stated that she pays almost twice her former transportation cost prior to COVID-19, and the prices have not gone down even after drivers began to carry more passengers than permitted by the social distancing protocol.”According to the report, in all the markets surveyed, the cost of making a pot of jollof rice increased in Awka, Calabar Municipal Market, Mbakpa, Onitsha, Port Harcourt and Trade Fair, while Balogun, Bauchi, Bodija, Dugbe, Kano, Nyanya and Wuse experienced a slight decrease.The South-South and South-East states experienced an increase in the cost of making Jollof rice, Northern states experienced a price reduction.The price decrease was attributed to the harvest period which usually forces prices of some commodities like onions and tomatoes down.It however suggested that this decrease may have failed to happen in the Southern part of the country because of the cost of transporting the goods down south and because of the price surge introduced by the food blockade.SOURCE: https://brandnewsday.com/2021/04/15/preparing-a-pot-of-jollof-rice-is-more-expensive-in-abuja-than-elsewhere-in-nigeria-sbm/"

Garba Moyi (rtd), said the measure was to avoid the abduction of pupils just as it happened in Katsina, Niger and Zamfara States.He added that the state Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal, had directed the state commissioner for education to merge those schools with the ones in towns.According to him, schools affected include those in Sabon Birni, Isa Rabah, Kebbe, Tangaza and Gudu local government areas.THISDAY gathered that 16 boarding schools were affected.The Zamfara State Government also closed boarding schools along the border towns after the Jangebe incident.In a reaction to the abduction of 279 pupils of Government Girls Secondary School in Jangebe, Talata Mafara LGA, Governor Bello Matawalle had shut down 10 schools along the borders with Sokoto and Katsina States.The state Commissioner for Education, Mr. Ibrahim Abdullahi, listed the 10 affected schools as Government Secondary Schools in Zurmi; GSS Birnin Magaji, (boarding) and G.A.S.S Zurmi (boarding); G.G.S.S Moriki (boarding); Science Secondary School Shinkafi (boarding); Science Secondary School, Dansadau (boarding); Science Secondary School, Bukkuyum (boarding); G.D.

445,,,"Insecurity: Why State of Emergency on Security is Necessary.ByAbdullahi D MohammedThe begining of new rainy season usually are anchored on many variables -- New and fresh produce or yield for the farmer, and a prospect for fresh grazing field for the herder. But, in today's nigeria, new rainy season brings with it, fear and anxiety, not from the likelihood of flooding along the country's riverine communities, but, from farming communities who insecurity has increasingly disrupted their trade.Recent challenge the President gave the new Service Chiefs to end insecurity before the new farming or raining season, is apt and commendable. By implication, there seems to be a new twist or fervor on the part of political actors; ostensibly as a result of backlash from Nigerians on the spate of Killings, and the high profile abductions of schoolboys and girls in Kagara and Jengebe, respectively.During the swearing in ceremony, the C-in-C charged the new Service Chiefs to bring to an end criminality and insurgency in the land. That to me, sounds like a target, set by a daring and intimidating boss. More so, that should have been the tone of Mr President.In the 21st century corporate world, there are no jobs without target. As such, every employer has some form of target for employees, and, they have to work accordingly to meet the threshold. Failure to do so, could lead to deduction of salaries, outright sack, or termination of appointment.In the public sector however, especially with the daunting and prevailing security challenges in the country, the President must be proactive, and take charge like a true General. Putting out a mere speech would not be enough. Doling out proclamations or order, as a task or target to the new Service Chiefs is the way to go. Set out a template, and a time frame within which they are expected to perform, and assessed. Such majors could potentially reduce, to the barest minimum rate of senseless killings in the country.The most noble step in achieving this is by foremostly declaring a State of Emergency on security. The no- fly zone declared must be extended to other states, and go beyond Zamfara, or the Northwest axis.If banditry in the country is exacerbated by porous borders, then, time to take effective control of the border is now. The infiltration of armed men into the country on the pretext of grazing must be checkmated or curtailed.Regardless of the ECOWAS Protocol on Transhumance adopted in 1998, which allows member states recognize cross-border pastoralist Transhumance, as economically viable, and an integral part of regional integration drive on the principle of free movement of persons, goods and services. Nigerian Government, in view of the security challenges must halt such movement until a more robust mechanism or framework is  developed which would secure the borders.The principle of free movement had obviously hurt the country lately. The pains, far outweighs the gains. States hit hard by insurgency and banditry are those sharing borders with or neighbors.The focus of the new Service Chiefs should be on the countless abandoned territories or spaces across the troubled states. Decades long neglect of communities allow undocumented persons build fortresses, and large followership with considerable influence on communities within their space and beyond. Using such fortresses as  launchpad for attacks and other criminalities became more and more prevalent, especially in the Forests across Northwest.Zamfara for instance, which is the epicenter of banditry, has many blaming political actors in the State of complicity. Competing for control, or possession of large land, which has rich Gold deposits was, as some experts say responsible for the spate of Killings. They benefit from illegal mining on the Gold fields for decades. The only medium to take off preying eyes on these activities is to create an atmosphere of chaos, fear and insecurity. Alternatively, they turn to the Fulani herders -- arm and empowered them. It is an open secret, well known within security and intelligence agencies in the country. Those fuelling, and benefiting from insecurity in Zamfara are known in the intelligence circle. Lack of political will to bring them to book, or  prosecute them, is entirely a story for another day.But, a major pointer to this is the rejection, by the Zamfara State House of Assembly the recent no-fly zone declared by the Federal Government. It leaves many to wonder, and, their motive suspect. At the moment, Zamfara, does not have a functional Airport, the hue and cry is needlessly aimed at derailing efforts of security operatives. Both the Executive and Legislative arms in the State seemingly enjoys some form of mutual relationship with the bandits. Hence, the peace initiative of the State Government has not yielded any positive. Kidnap for ransom has not abated, sacking of communities has not too. Currently, most boarding schools in the State are shutdown for fear of attacks. Obviously, the peace or amnesty is not working.Which is why, the call for the rejection for an amnesty or pardon to the bandits has been amplified lately, across different quarters. Surreptitiously, the bandits had found a lucrative venture, with zero investment and a large quick turnover. Abandoning such ventures is no mean task.Government must extract a commitment pledge from the Service Chiefs --  accomplish the task, or get sacked!Securing the country is so significant to be subjected to partisanship. Most developed economies  prioritize their national security, against any form of parochial or personal interest. In nigeria, instead of taking full responsibility, and consider how lethal insecurity is, political actors oftentimes politicize almost everything, including national security. Failing to take into account that, securing the country first is a recipe for any enduring and sustainable development.What characterizes the tenure of immediate Service Chiefs, were allegations of endemic malfeasance. Many reports are in the public space, where top military brass, as well as Junior officers complain of insufficient arms, which, affects the morale and fighting spirit of their combatant soldiers. Weapons used by Nigerian soldiers are said to be inferior, when compared to the sophisticated arms used by the insurgents. A new drive, motivation and vigour must be injected in the fight against insecurity.Intelligence and technology, rather than an all-out combat are some of the mechanism adopted in prosecuting a 21st century guerilla-like warfare. Technology, for instance, reduces fatalities and casualties on the part of government forces. Reconnaissance, with the aid of drone was partly responsible for successes recorded by Chadian forces which gave Boko Haram terrorist a bloody nose last year.Even the ill-fated Helicopter crash which killed 7 gallant Nigerian Airforce personel last February would have been averted had the authorities concern resorted to the use of surveillance drones to detect the whereabouts of the Kagara school boys.nigeria must not cave in to the demand of the terrorist in whatever guise. The closure of boarding schools across the region signifies one thing -- reactionary stance and complacency. Precedence had been set, with the abductions of Chibok school girls, that ought to have put Government on its toes, to atleast anticipate and be proactive in the face of any eventuality, or aggression.Atleast, since schools are being targeted, securing and fortifying them should come top of government to do list. For an educationally disadvantaged region, shutting down schools, especially Girl's, would automatically reduce enrollment, as most parents would either marry them off, or, for those who could afford, send them to private schools. Either way, it portends a grave danger to education in the region.We all heard gory details of massacres of farmers by bandits which had affected or threaten food security in the country. Most had to pay to have access, to their farmlands. Bandits openly tax farming communities across Katsina, Zamfara and Sokoto. Now that another farming season is approaching, and the C-in-C had issued a statement to the Service Chiefs, it is expected he do a follow-up, by declaring a State of Emergency on security. This would put every single security personnel on his or her toes. Legislatures must also ensure, through various committees on matters of security, synergize with relevant stakeholders on security. Communities are helpless, the best they could do is alert security operatives in the event of an attack, which they graciously do. Heeding the advice of Defence Minister is simply suicidal, an armless civilian, confronting an armed terrorist is sheer stupidity.Mere statement by Mr President to the new Service Chiefs would not change the configuration, or pattern of security in the country. But, setting targets, tasking and tracking their activities would effectively have an impact on the Modus operandi; and hopefully, we would see peace and return to the land.At this point, we feverishly wait, and hope banditry and criminality ends, at least, before the rainy season begins, so our farmers could access their farmlands, and our school boys and girls return to school.With the new Service Chiefs on board, a state of emergency on security in place, we sure can heave a sigh of relief, and await real progress.Abdullahi D Mohammed is with the Department of Political Science and International Studies at the Ahmadu Bello University-Zaria.He writes from Kanoabdullahkidnyce@gmail.com"

451,,,"Setting foot into nigeria's export/import market can be quite challenging, especially for beginners. There are certain regulations and rules you must be aware of to avoid future conflicts. Here are some tips to guide you:Know the MarketThe Nigerian market and trade industry mainly depends on importation, which means manufacturers must develop a deep understanding of the market dynamics, rising demands, and customer demographics. They should also seek expert advice to ensure they are properly following all regulations.Be Aware of Trade Laws and PoliciesIn 2019, nigeria decided to close its border because ECOWAS member states were negating the country's trade laws. Thus, manufacturers need to be aware of all regional, domestic, and international trade laws to avoid similar situations.It is critical to know that nigeria has stringent restrictive policies on certain imports and exports. Therefore, businesses interested in the Nigerian market must know which items or products are prohibited by the government. Moreover, in 2016, the Central Bank of nigeria (CBN) imposed foreign exchange (forex) restrictions on 41 items and has even extended this list to include corn and maize last July.Know the Regulatory Agencies in Charge of Export/Import ActivitiesGovernment agencies like Standards Organisation of nigeria (SON), National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), the nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC), Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), and more are in charge of regulating trade in nigeria. Thus, to access the import/export market, companies must know each of the agency's functions and make sure they are following all the guidelines. Bureaucratic and Technical Issues Companies must also know the bureaucratic, technical, and infrastructure issues that can make or break their businesses. There is a NAFDAC 90-day turnaround for product registration, which may take longer because of bureaucratic bottlenecks. You may need to obtain a SONCAP Certificate (SC) as well, which is a mandatory document used by the Nigerian Customs Services for clearance of goods traveling to nigeria.You will need to find a shipping company that will bring in your products as well. Obtain a customs manifest or bill of lading from the NPA or private terminals and make a payment for import or excise duties and customs clearance.

503,,,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded an Article IV consultation with the Nigerian government and has welcomed the notable reforms undertaken in the fiscal sector, including the removal of a fuel subsidy and steps to implement cost-reflective tariff increases in the power sector.The IMF states that nigeria’s economy had been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Following a sharp drop in oil prices and capital outflows, real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have contracted by 3.2% in 2020.The country’s headline inflation rose to 14.9% in November 2020, which marked a 33-month high, reflecting core and food inflation increases emanating from supply shortages due to the lockdown effected to curb infections, alongside the land-border closure and continued import restrictions.The unemployment rate reached 27% in the second quarter of the year, with youth unemployment at 41%.The Nigerian authorities acted swiftly to adopt a pandemic-related support package equivalent to 0.3% of GDP in the 2020 revised federal Budget despite limited fiscal space.External vulnerabilities owing to lower oil prices and weak global demand have increased, with the current account remaining in deficit in the first half of 2021.In April 2020, nigeria received IMF emergency financial assistance of $3.5-billion under the Rapid Financing Instrument to help cushion the impact of the pandemic.The IMF notes that socioeconomic conditions have deteriorated, with rising food inflation, elevated youth unemployment and mass protests in October last year, and says surveys show worsening food insecurity with a significant impact on the vulnerable.Risks are tilted to the downside and include the resurgence of the pandemic, security situation and unfavourable external environment.Capital outflow risks arise from the record-low domestic interest rates and large foreign holdings of domestic securities.On the upside, recovering oil prices and the completion of the Dangote oil refinery could catalyse more domestic crude oil production and boost growth.The IMF executive directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the authorities for the measures taken to address the health and economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic which have exacerbated pre-existing weaknesses.Looking ahead, the IMF’s directors emphasised the need for urgent policy adjustment in nigeria and more fundamental reforms to sustain macroeconomic stability and lift growth and employment.They further stressed the need for significant revenue mobilisation to reduce fiscal sustainability risks, relying initially on progressive and efficiency-enhancing measures with higher tax rates awaiting a more sustained economic recovery.They also highlighted the need for improved social safety nets to cushion potential negative impacts on the poor.The IMF directors noted that multiple rates, limited flexibility and foreign exchange shortages are posing challenges. They recommended a gradual and multi-step approach to establishing a unified and clear exchange rate regime with the near-term focus on allowing for greater flexibility and removing the payments backlog.Further, the IMF observed that the accommodative monetary stance remains appropriate in the near term, although tightening may be warranted if balance of payments or inflationary pressures were to increase.In the medium term, the monetary policy operational framework should be reformed and the central bank financing of the budget deficit phased out in order to reduce inflation.While welcoming the resilience of the banking sector, the IMF directors also called for continued vigilance to contain financial stability risks. They noted that Covid-19 debt relief measures for bank clients should remain time-bound and limited to those with good pre-crisis fundamentals.Lastly, the directors welcomed recent progress in structural reforms and called for continued reforms aimed at promoting economic diversification and reducing the dependence on oil and increasing employment.In addition, they encouraged strengthening governance and anticorruption frameworks, including compliance with Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism measures.The directors also welcomed the country’s ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Area and underscored that implementing trade-enabling reforms remains critical to rejuvenate growth."

On the other side, some see it as a welcome development as many lazy Nigerian youths are now using it to propagate their fraudulent deals popularly known as yahoo yahoo. They perpetuate their shady transactions under the guise of doing genuine Bitcoin trade transactions. The Central Bank of nigeria has last week ordered banks to close all accounts of their customers perceived to be dealing with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the country. But many see this latest action by the federal government as closing up the economy. What nigeria needs now, perhaps more than ever, are jobs and an opening up of our economy, especially after today’s report by the National Bureau of Statistics indicated that foreign capital inflow into nigeria is at a four year low, having plummeted from $23.9 billion in 2019, to just $9.68 billion in 2020.Already, the nation suffered severe economic losses from the border closure, and the effects of the #COVID19 pandemic.This is definitely the wrong time to introduce policies that will restrict the inflow of capital into nigeria, and I urge that the policy to prohibit the dealing and transaction of cryptocurrencies be revisited.https://dambela.com/2021/02/07/bitcoinmixed-reactions-trail-ban-on-cryptocurrencies-in-nigeria/"

523,,,"Cement manufacturers in nigeria are an anomaly with regards to profitability, compared to most other established global producers of the centuries old building material, amid an outcry in the country over surging cement prices.MoneyCentral analysed the financial statements of the 3 major cement manufacturers in nigeria, Dangote Cement, Lafarge Africa and BUA cement, who together control 100 percent of the market, and compared it that of 7 other major global cement producers.The data shows that the Nigerian cement firms have the highest profit margins in the world.Ordinarily this would have been a good financial metric to get excited about but with the optics of ever rising cement prices in nigeria, juxtaposed against producers with outsized profits, it can be rightly seen as a problem that needs addressing.Profit margin is a measure of profitability calculated by finding the net profit at any given period as a percentage of the revenue.In finance profit margin is important because it shows how much of every naira of revenue is flowing to the bottom line.Nigerian cement manufacturers retain quite a huge chunk of their revenues as profits defying the trend seen in most other parts of the globe and in Africa itself.Cement producers are generally high volume, low margins producers because of a number of reasons including the high energy costs of running cement plants, carbon emission taxes, and the commoditized nature of the product which is produced with often little innovation.Dangote Cement, nigeria’s largest company by market capitalization and the country’s biggest cement producer has production capacity of 45.6 million tonnes per year across ten countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.The firm has integrated factories in seven countries, a clinker grinding plant in Cameroon and import and distribution facilities for bulk cement in Ghana and Sierra Leone. Together, these operations make it the largest cement producer in Sub-Saharan Africa.Dangote’s Nigerian operations more profitable than Rest of AfricaMoneyCentral’s deep dive into the 245 pages long 2019 annual report of Dangote Cement shows that the Nigerian operations of the firm are more profitable than that of the Group as a whole, while its Pan African operations are less profitable than the consolidated Group operations.In other words, nigeria operations are the cash cow of Dangote cement and it is extremely profitable with nigeria Alone profit margins of 45 percent as at year end 2019, compared to 23 percent for the Group as a whole and negative margins for Pan African operations.Dangote cements Group revenue and results by reportable segment shows that Nigerian operations had revenues of N610.2 billion and profit after tax of N275.1 billion (equivalent to 45% profit margins).Pan Africa operations reported a loss after tax of N85.29 billion on revenues of N282.7 billion leading to negative margins of -30 percent, while the Group (nigeria plus Pan Africa) reported revenues of N891.67 billion and profits of N200.5 billion for a 23 percent profit margin.For the most recent nine-month period ended 30 September, 2020 the Company generated revenues of N761.44 billion and net profits of N208.69 billion. The Groups Q3, 2020 profit margins were equivalent to 28.77 percent.Lafarge Africa and BUA Cementnigeria’s two other major cement manufacturers Lafarge Africa and BUA cement also reported elevated profit margins compared to peers across the globe.Lafarge’s profit margins as at year end 2019 was equivalent to 54 percent on revenues of N212.9 billion and net income of N115.1 billion. Lafarge had onetime gains from the disposal of its South African operations in the period.BUA Cement also had high profit margins of 35.53 percent in 2019 and 33.9 percent as at Q3, 2020 respectively. Sales came in at N55.28 billion with net income of N18.74 billion reported for the Q3, 2020 period.Profit margins of global cement manufacturersMoneyCentral looked at the top cement manufacturers globally that have publicly available financial statements, analysed those statements and calculated the respective profit margins of the cement makers to compare against Nigerian peers (See table below).The data shows that Nigerian cement manufacturers enjoy the highest profit margins in the world.Analysis of the financial data from cement makers from North America (Cemex), Europe (Heidelberg Cement), China (Anhui Conch Cement Co), India (Ultra Tech Cement) and Indonesia (Sem Indonesia), shows that Nigerian cement makers are low volume high priced manufacturers, compared to their peers who are high volume low priced players.Dangote Cement for instance which controls 64 percent of the Nigerian market is the lowest cement producer profiled among the group in terms of volume (14.1 million tons produced in nigeria in 2019) but has the highest profit margins.What causes high profit marginsThere is a feeling in nigeria that the concentration among the top three cement producers, who together dominate the entire market, combined with practically impossible barriers erected for new entrants are responsible for ever rising cement prices.Profit margin, which is the ratio of profits to sales, is a key financial target for most firms. Companies often use their pricing strategy to generate their target profit margins.Firms can then set prices to achieve these target margins, while remaining somewhat competitive in the market. However, if a company wants to compete on price alone, it must have a low enough cost structure and achieve sufficient sales volume to generate profits.So the question will be, is there really something unique about nigeria’s cement market or is something else going on?Dangote Cement’s experience in its pan Africa operations shows that there may be some truth to allegations of excessive high pricing by the 3 Nigerian cement makers.In South Africa where Dangote Cement’s sales numbers cannot be published due to local competition laws, annual sales volume for the firm in 2019 decreased by 9.4 percent year on year (y-o-y): “mainly due to low demand and increased competition from importers and blenders,” according to statements it made in its financials.In other words, Dangote is acknowledging that more competition in the South African markets from imports led to lower sales.Losses incurred in Dangote Cements Pan African operations suggests that pricing power is weaker overseas than at home in nigeria.Even at an EBITDA (Earnings Before Interests Taxes Depreciation and Amortization) level, margins for the Pan African operations were equivalent to 16.92 percent, compared to 59.1 percent for Nigerian operations alone, while the operating profit margin was just 1.41 percent for pan African operations, compared to 50.42 percent for Nigerian operations alone.Little value added?Critics claim that Nigerian cement manufacturers have added very little value to the economy over the years with their industry protected by Government and as such they are doing more harm than good to the Nigerian economy.“nigeria’s cement policy has been a complete failure,” said Feyi Fawehinmi, accountant, writer and social media influencer based in the U.K., and a strident critic of Nigerian governments cement policy.“If you are going to have a policy supporting the production of an input (cement), the only sensible way to measure the success of that policy is to measure the things that input goes into (housing).”Fawehinmi contends that Nigerian cement producers have not added any local innovation or research and development, to improve the body of cement knowledge that has been in existence for 2,000 years and hence should not be setting prices so high.“All the technology used to manufacture cement in nigeria is simply imported from China,” Fawehinmi said.At MoneyCentral we would not quite go as far as to suggest little value addition by Nigerian cement firms.Dangote Cement for instance supports many businesses that participate in the supply chain and help them thrive and build their own businesses.The number of retailers and distributors in Dangote cement’s Nigerian distribution chain grew year-on-year, from 7,000 to 10,000, and from 568 to 685, respectively, representing a percentage growth of 43 percent and 21 percent for each category.We also believe listing of the cement businesses by their owners (Dangote and BUA) make financial and corporate disclosures more transparent.BUA Cement for its part is investing to increase its capacity by an additional 9 million metric tonnes per annum. The new capacity addition should take BUA to about 17 Million tonnes Per Annum in the Nigerian market. New addition of capacity should in theory bring prices down in a truly competitive market.Nigerian cement manufacturers have also largely built their plants all in the past decade or so, helping them to tiptoe around legacy emissions issues being faced by older cement companies in the West.“DCP plants have all been built in the last twelve years. They have been designed to be intrinsically efficient through the adoption of cutting edge technology in cement production,” Dangote Cement said in its 2019 financial statement.The firms are also not immune from disruptions happening in the wider macro economy. Land exports for Dangote cement for instance reduced to 0.45Mt from 0.7Mt for the full year owing to the border closure in the last few months of 2019.What can be done?The Nigerian government evidently worried about high cement prices recently reached an agreement with cement manufacturers to charge discounted prices as part of its plan to construct 300,000 houses for low-income Nigerians, under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP).The price of cement late last year touched a high of N4,100 per bag, a development that the government blamed on the #End SARs protests.In Lagos at the time of filing this piece the price of cement hovers between N3,200 – N3,500 per bag, depending on the brand.MoneyCentral’s enquiries from Ghana shows that the retail price of a bag of Dangote cement is 39.5 Ghana cedis, roughly $6.50 or N3,000, making it less expensive in Ghana than in nigeria even though the market is supplied from Nigerian factories.The solution to the problem inherently lies with cement pricing in nigeria and how it is arrived at by manufacturers, middle-men and retailers.The usual refrain likely to be heard about high cost of energy, poor road and transport infrastructure, high cost of capital and other costs hindering cement manufacturers, would only apply to any potential new entrants and not current cement manufacturers who have attained dominant position in the market, as can be seen by their ability to generate world beating profit margins.In other words, even after taking into consideration total manufacturing costs of N379.9 billion (including fuel and power, salaries, plant maintenance and raw materials) incurred by Dangote Cement in 2019, the firm still managed to remain one of the most profitable cement firms in the world based on its pricing power.To truly get cement prices to trend lower the Federal Government then needs to enforce competition in the sector.That would entail an improvement in the anti-trust or competition laws of nigeria, to enthrone true competition in the nations’ cement sector.New entrants must also be encouraged with tax breaks while a cap or moratorium should be placed on tax breaks given to dominant and established cement names.Finally, the Federal Government should consider removing barriers to importation of cement into nigeria. As can be seen from the South African example, imports did help to bring prices down to the benefit of consumers.https://www.google.com/amp/s/moneycentral.com.ng/fixed-income-bonds/article/nigerian-cement-manufacturers-have-worlds-highest-profit-margins/%3famp"

525,,,"THE discomfiting reality of nigeria’s emergent food crisis was poignantly brought home recently by the Chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council, Doyin Salami. He revealed during the National Economic Outlook for 2021 organised by the Chartered Institute of Bankers of nigeria that the country spent a whopping N1.85 trillion to import food for nine months during the closure of its land borders. Salami blamed the flooding that ravaged parts of the country in 2019 as the critical factor responsible for the development, noting that “climatic concerns are undermining agricultural output with 2.5 million farmers being impacted by flooding in 2019.” Between April and September 2019, the West Africa Network for Peacebuilding said flooding claimed cumulatively, the lives of 95 people (including 17 females and 31 children), 45 people were injured with an estimated 722,741 people displaced and 351,236 others in need of humanitarian assistance in nigeria.Food crisis occurs when local production cannot meet domestic demand. It is every nation’s worst nightmare. Given the established nexus between food security and national security, this is a very worrying but avoidable scenario, underscoring the inability of the country to feed its 206 million people. The United Nations says, “Agriculture, including fisheries and forestry, remains a primary livelihood source for 86 per cent of the world’s rural population, providing jobs for an estimate of 1.3 billion smallholders and landless workers.” Sadly, in nigeria, agriculture continues to decelerate, growing at 1.7 per cent year-to-date, while consumer-sensitive sectors like manufacturing and distribution continue to contract, in double digits, Salami lamented.Contrary to official claims, this disclosure particularly laid bare the inefficacy of the border closure policy of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Citing economic losses and illegal arms/drugs trade, nigeria had abruptly shut its land borders with the Benin Republic in August 2019. Not satisfied with the outcome, it extended the ban to the land trade with all its other neighbours in October, a tactic that reverberated around the sub-region. Additionally, it prohibited fuel supply to petrol filling stations within 20-kilometre radius of its borders. However, in December 2020, the President ordered the reopening of the country’s land borders in Seme, Illela, Maigatari, and Mfun, following strident criticism from stakeholders. In particular, the Manufacturers Association of nigeria deemed it “a negation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement’s liberalisation agenda,” which nigeria had ratified as a member-state.It surely calls for concern that, as Salami said, “Despite border closure, our national import of food amounted to N1.85 trillion between January and September 2020 – a 62 per cent increase when compared with the same period in 2019. This suggests a weakness in our ability to feed ourselves and raises the need to consider review of intervention policies in agriculture.”With COVID-19 pandemic, Islamist terrorism and murderous Fulani herders ravaging the land and spilling blood, all  the signs point to a significant fall in domestic agricultural output.  It is trite that a nation that cannot feed itself will not be able to undertake the more taxing job of securing its citizens and protecting itself from threats to its territorial integrity and/or exert any meaningful weight in the comity of nations. nigeria’s case is despairing and pathetic and should be reversed. From 2016 to the first half of 2019, the National Bureau of Statistics estimated that the country spent N54.51 trillion importing manufactured goods, mostly food and agricultural goods. Within the period, agricultural goods import gulped N38.24 billion, while manufactured goods import gulped 19.51 billion. The effect of this on the value of the national currency and economy as a whole is telling.With the added security challenge, evidenced in seemingly endless Fulani herdsmen’s destruction of farmlands with their rampaging cattle, as well as killing of farmers in the South and North-Central, rural banditry and Boko Haram attacks in the farming communities in the North-West and North-East, the country is sadly walking the path of imminent hunger. It is inevitable therefore that agricultural production will suffer immeasurably, leading to recourse to greater food imports with dire consequences on a recessed economy. This demands an urgent action by the government at all levels.Data from the NBS and the Central Bank of nigeria published in the International Journal of Economics, Commerce and Management indicated that nigeria spent over N40 trillion on food imports in 21 years, between 1990 and 2011 to meet domestic consumption. This translates to food imports of an average of N1.92 trillion per year and N1 billion every day. The data further showed that the annual food import bill was in multiples of five times of export. This is unacceptable for a country blessed with a youthful population and endowed with huge cultivable land. Statistics showed that in the last four to five years, the agriculture sector’s contribution to GDP hovered between 22 and 25 per cent. In 2017, it hit an all-time low of 21 per cent contribution to GDP. It is also estimated that while American families spend only 16 per cent of their budget on food, their Nigerian counterparts spend 73 per cent of their budgets to eat.What is required is a combination of well-thought-out policy measures and pragmatic actions by the government to address the situation, especially at the subnational level. For one, the various governments should be more deliberate in implementing policies and programmes that will engender rural development to stem the rural-urban drift that has depleted the farming population in the rural areas. Life in the vast agrarian communities of the country is at best cruel and brutish with deplorable and inaccessible roads, lack of electricity and non-existent storage facilities.State governments should be challenged to the imperative of engendering rural development to give a fillip to agricultural productivity to stave off the looming food crisis. An expert at PwC, an audit and consultancy firm, Oladele Oladipupo, said the level of agricultural yield in the country owes largely to the absence of concentration on the agriculture value chain, despite nigeria’s vast arable land.

The product isbeing illegally imported from the neighbouring BeninRepublic before being repackaged for distribution todifferent parts of the country.The centres for rebagging are opposite the AdeniranOgunsanya College of Education (ACOED), Iyana-Era;the Igbolerin Junction by Jolag; and the Alaba RagoMarket, all along the Mile 2- Badagry Expressway.At these centres, smugglers, mainly women, bring inforeign rice in small bags which they repackage inbigger ones for onward distribution.At the Igbolerin Junction, one of the smugglers toldour correspondent, who disguised as a customer, thatthey ferried the rice from Benin Republic into nigeriathrough unapproved routes near the Seme borderafter paying tokens to urchins known as “crossers”.The smuggler explained that, “It is the crossers whowill then bring the rice to J-5 Park at Seme, fromwhere they are handed over to their owners. At J-5Park, owners are charged by the bus driversaccording to quantity. It costs at least N2,000 totransport a bag of rice from Seme to the Alaba RagoMarket.”At the Rago market, which is a big distribution pointfor foreign rice, merchants said the profit they got faroutweighed what they got from local rice and ourreporter saw foreign rice in bags with local namesaimed to beat customs officers.According to a Ketu-based marketer, Khadija Amar,Nigerian rice is no longer selling, saying many peoplehave lost interest in consuming it.Amar said, “A bag of local rice which we ought to sellat over N20,000 is now being sold at N17,500. Someof us have N3,000 shortage, and for others, it’sN4,000. So we prefer to deal in foreign rice. Anotherdealer, Miss Ibeh Mary Abigail, said, “We have foreignrice everywhere in the market because it movesfaster than local rice.”RiversReports from Port Harcourt in Rivers State showedthat many markets and shops now have largequantities of foreign rice in stock. At the Mile 1, Mile3, Borokiri, New Road, Oyigbo and Eleme markets,foreign brands of rice are gradually taking over themarkets and are openly displayed without anychallenge.A trader at Mile 1 who pleaded anonymity, said therice was brought in from Lagos and Calabar.PlateauIn Plateau State, our correspondent who visited theYankwalli Market reported that foreign rice hadflooded the market with many shop ownersdisplaying it unchallenged.Aminu Mubi, a dealer in the market, told Daily Trustthat although there was foreign rice in the marketeven before the ban on border was lifted, the productwas flooding the market now and threatening localrice.Mubi explained that, “When the border was closedthe price of a bag reached N27,000, but it hasdropped to N23,000, and there is a possibility that itwill drop further.”KanoIn some supermarkets in Kano, foreign rice is nowfreely on display unlike in previous months, but theprice has dropped. At the Singer Commodity Market,a 50kg bag of foreign rice is now selling at N23,500instead of N26,000.A dealer at the market, Sanusi Hassan, said, “Thelocal rice is now endangered as people prefer to buyforeign rice which is sold at almost the same price asthe local rice.”Hassan added that, “Government must do somethingto salvage the situation and protect the localindustry.”AbujaA visit to some markets in Abuja indicated thatforeign rice is still sold in large quantities with tradersdisplaying it outside their stalls.A trader at the Wuse Market, Agatha Ezekiel, said shesold a bag of foreign rice at N26,000 and local riceat N19,500.KatsinaIn Katsina, our reporter observed an influx of foreignrice, but some of the traders said it had nothing to dowith the recent border reopening, as nigeria’s borderwith Niger Republic at Jibia, Kwangwalam andMai’adua were still closed.A trader, Tasiu Sani, said, “All our goods are oldstock and that is what we are selling.”Daily Trust gathered that the goods come inpiecemeal on daily basis through bush paths underthe name “Hatsin Hajiya” in which a bag is dividedinto three to pass checkpoints.Growers lamentSome rice farmers said they watched with dismay theresurfacing of foreign rice in many markets acrossthe country despite the effort to sustain local drive.Abdullahi Lapai from Niger State attributed the uglysituation to the activities of smugglers, who he saidwere gradually having a free time following theborder reopening. Lapai said, “If the local processorsare unable to sell their produce, it will affect the priceof paddy, which will in turn discourage local farmersfrom more production.”The National President of the All Farmers Associationof nigeria (AFAN), Kabir Ibrahim, said bringing inforeign rice would draw the country back from thegains made so far.Consignment of smuggled rice seized by men of the NigerianCustoms Service in LagosAccording to him, smuggling does not really happenoften unless it is aided by law enforcement agentsand the citizenry. Ibrahim said, “If there is anycontraband displayed in a shop and it is freely sold,then it goes beyond government and the officerscharged with border control. The entire citizenry muststand against it for it to stop.”Processors on edgeA rice processor, Alhaji Nasiru Yahaya, raised alarmthat many local processors were in shock followingthe influx of foreign rice, adding that the situation wasaffecting local producers.Alhaji Yahaya further said most of the processorsborrowed money to invest when the governmentannounced the country’s rice sufficiency drive.He explained that, “This is not about us only, millionsof direct and indirect jobs will be lost if local brandsare relegated to the previous position.”A small holder miller in Sabon Wuse, a Niger Statecommunity along the Abuja-Kaduna Expressway, NuruJiya, said the volume of local rice sales had reduceddrastically following the presence of foreign rice inmany shops.‘Nemesis catching up with processors’An agriculturist, Ibrahim Kunle, said although therewas the need for relevant authorities to check anyform of smuggling, local rice processors should getno one’s sympathy, noting that they were thearchitects of the current hike in the price of localbrands. Kunle alleged that, “We all know when someof these processors are deliberately causing artificialscarcity of local brands with the aim of hiking price.“What they do is to mop up paddy from farmers andstore them instead of milling them and selling. This iscausing serious concerns even to the government.”Another agriculturist, Mallam Audu Ishak, said, “Thesepeople will go and take money from the government,promising heaven, but let me tell you, they are part ofthe problem, and thank God government is nowrealising that.”A stakeholder who craved anonymity, saidgovernment was being careful in giving money tosome of the processors because of the way some ofthem betrayed agreements.Although these claims against the processors havenot been confirmed, a source at the Federal Ministryof Agriculture told our reporter that government wasconcerned about the continued rise in the price oflocal rice despite the huge effort and resources beingcommitted to rice production in the country.The Director General of the Rice ProcessorsAssociation of nigeria (RIPAN), Andy Ekwelem,promised to get back to our reporter when a call wasput across to him but did not up to the time of filingthis report.What should be done – ExpertsExperts in the sector want relevant security outfits tointensify border patrol to further check the activitiesof smugglers.Mathew Inawole, an agric economist, said effectiveborder control would go a long way in reducing thevolume of foreign rice crossing into the country,adding that there should be a total clampdown onthose selling the foreign brands as they werecontraband.Mallam Abdullahi Baba, an agriculturist, saidgovernment should orientate the citizens on thedangers involved in eating some smuggled items.Customs reactThe Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the FederalOperations Unit (FOU) of the nigeria Customs Service(NCS), Zone A, Theophilus Sunita, in a telephoneinterview, said the zone, as an enforcement unit ofNCS in charge of Lagos and Ogun states, had alwaysbeen on top of its game.Sunita said several thousands of bags of foreign ricehad been seized by operatives from the zone fromdiehard smugglers.He added that, “However, we rely on members of thepublic to avail us with useful and timely information.”https://dailytrust.com/despite-importation-ban-foreign-rice-floods-nigerian-marketsmynd44 oam4j lalasticlala tjskii MissyB3"

545,,,"The nigeria Customs Service (NCS) yesterday shut nigeria’s border with Niger Republic at Jibia, Katsina State less than 48 hours the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) reopened it in line with the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari.Consequently, the decision of the customs service sparked mild protest among traders in communities around the border, alleging that the customs officers closed the border to continue their illegal activities in the area.THISDAY uncovered the contravention of Buhari’s directive yesterday during a visit to the border post at Jibia, Jibia Local Government Area (LGA), Katsina State.On December 16, 2020, Buhari approved the immediate reopening of four major land borders in nigeria after 15 months of outright closure that stoked stern criticism across Africa.While he directed immediate reopening of the land borders, the president did not approve the importation of rice, poultry and other counterfeit products.Consistent with Buhari’s directive, the Comptroller General of Immigration (CGI), Mr. Muhammed Babandede had on Thursday directed the immediate reopening of the nigeria-Niger border.Babandede conveyed this directive in a three-paragraph circular addressed to the Katsina State Comptroller of the Immigration Service.Babandede was quoted in the circular saying the federal government “has directed the nigeria Immigration Service to reopen all land borders in the country but with strict adherence to Presidential Task Force protocols on COVID-19 pandemic.”Consequently, there was ceremonial reopening of the border on Thursday which was well-attended by traders within and outside the country, including the Deputy Comptroller of Immigration in charge of the border, DCI H. Ibrahim, customs officers and police at the frontier of the border.During the visit to the border post yesterday, however, THISDAY observed that the officials of the customs service restricted human and vehicular movement across the border post while its main entrance was under lock despite the directive of the president.THISDAY, also, observed that the operatives of the customs service denied traders and travellers entry and exit at the border town.It equally observed that there was restriction of movement as checking of goods and vehicles remained in place at more than 20 checkpoints mounted by armed customs and police officers along Katsina-Jibia highway.The customs service, however, justified its action on the ground that it had not received a formal directive from its supervising ministry to reopen the border.An official of the customs service, who spoke private with THISDAY, said security agencies at the border post were still expecting official directives to reopen the border.He said: “We heard about the reopening of the land borders from the news, but we are still waiting for directives from our head office in Abuja. We can not just open the border like that.“As you can see, when the border was closed, the federal government introduced Joint border Patrol which comprises Army, Immigration, Police and Customs.So, we must receive an official letter from our head office as members of border drill before we will open it,” the customs officer said anonymously.Concerned about the conflicting directives, some traders in separate interviews in Jibia yesterday lamented endless extortions by customs officers, claiming that the customs officers closed the border to continue with their illegalities in the area."

549,,,"nigeria Inflation soared to a 37-month high of 15.75% (Vetiva:15.91%) in December, driven more recently by festive demand alongside earlier multiple cost-push factors which stoked prices all through 2020-border closure, supply chain disruptions, FX and energy reforms.These translated to an average inflation outcome of 13.25% (Vetiva: 13.22%) for the year, reflective of the business climate hostilities that characterized the year on account of the pandemic.Structural factors raise inflationary pressures on the non-edible segmentCore inflation rose by 32bps to a 34-month high of 11.37% y/y (Nov’20: 11.05% y/y) no thanks to pre-existing pressures. Given the 31.5% y/y depreciation in the parallel exchange rate and 10.3% y/y higher fuel prices, all sub-divisions of the core segment experienced inflationary pressures.Reflecting higher energy costs, the Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and other fuels (HWGS) inflation spiked to a 39-month high of 9.08% (Nov’20: 8.72%). Meanwhile, other segments continued to reel from multiple inflations levers. Health and transport inflation lead other core segments, rising to multi-year highs of 14.06% and 11.76% respectively.FX and energy pressures to steer inflation furtherAs we progress into the new year, we expect reform implementation to continually take a toll on consumer prices. Pre-existing headwinds and base effect will drive inflation further to 16.73% y/y in the current month, despite the reopening of the borders and suspension of electricity tariff review.In 2021, erosion of purchasing power is imminent given implementation of reforms in the energy sector. In addition, the continuing divergence of the parallel market rate from the official peg alongside persistent current account deficit raises fears of further FX-related inflationary pressures. Thus, we expect inflation for the year to an average of 18.91% (2020: 13.25%).SOURCE:https://brandspurng.com/2021/01/16/nigeria-inflation-cost-push-pressures-stoke-prices-all-year/"

555,,,"*STATE HOUSE PRESS RELEASE**SECURITY CHECKLIST, AS nigeria MARKS ARMED FORCES REMEMBRANCE DAY, BY PRESIDENCY* January 15 every year is commemorated as Armed Forces Remembrance Day.As the milestone is marked this year, it also provides ample opportunity to chronicle current landmark achievements by our military in tackling security challenges in the land, towards fulfilling the constitutional requirement of Government guaranteeing the protection of lives and property.A checklist below:INTERNAL SECURITY:Boko Haram is much weaker today than in 2015, as attested to by the Governor of Borno State on December 6, 2020:“From state-wide statistics on affairs in the 27 Local Government Areas since 2011, the fact is that despite the recent happenings in Borno State, the security situation in Borno State and, indeed, that of the entire North East sub-region is still far better under Buhari, and this is based on records.“For instance, unlike the years before Buhari when a number of local governments were no-go-areas, we now have indigenes safely back to Gwoza, Askira-Uba, Dikwa, Ngala, Monguno, Kukawa, Damboa, Konduga, Mafa and led by our traditional leaders, which no one could have visited not to talk of living there. Our Emirs were all in exile. Today, Bama is coming back to life and so is Askira-Uba, Damboa, Gwoza and others. Life is even returning to Baga. This was impossible before Buhari.“In fact, it was not possible to move few kilometres out of Maiduguri.  Insurgents were so bold to attack and take over military facilities, like the Army Barracks at Monguno, Bama, Giwa Barrack and Multinational Joint Task Force Headquarters at Baga, to mention just a few. There were daily bomb blast attacks in many parts of Maiduguri, the most populated part of the state but all these have stopped under President Buhari. These are the records and no one can dispute them.” HIGHLIGHTS OF DEFENCE HEADQUARTERS-COORDINATED OPERATIONS, 18 MARCH TO 30 DECEMBER, 2020: • The Armed Forces of nigeria from 18 March to 30 December, 2020 neutralized 2,403 criminal elements (terrorists, bandits, kidnappers, cattle rustlers, etc.) across the country. • This is in addition to scores of other terrorists and armed bandits killed during air strikes. • Troops also rescued a total of 864 kidnapped victims across the country. • In addition, a total of 9,684,797 litres of stolen AGO and 33,516,000 litres of DPK were recovered. • Equally, 1,910 criminal elements were arrested and large cache of arms, ammunition and equipment were recovered during the period. • Furthermore, a total of 46,581.8 barrels of stolen crude oil and 22,881,257 litres of stolen PMS were recovered by the troops of the Armed Forces of nigeria.

NORTH-EAST SECURITY ACHIEVEMENTS, 2015-2020 Specifically, in the North East, the Armed Forces have since 2015 recorded significant achievements in the fight against terrorism in nigeria. The first actions of the Buhari Administration in that regard were: •      Revitalization of the Multi-National Joint Task Force comprising nigeria and her neighbours;•      Relocation of the Military Command and Control Center to Maiduguri    in June 2015;•     Launch of Operation Lafiya Dole in July 2015. Since then, several towns and villages have been reclaimed from Boko Haram, thousands of hostages have been freed from terrorist enclaves, and tens of thousands of displaced persons have been resettled. Several Boko Haram leaders have been killed or arrested, and the arrest of Khalid al-Barnawi of the Ansaru splinter cell brought an end to the terrorists’ tight grip on North Central nigeria. The Federal Government is investing heavily in military hardware, including 23 new aircraft that have already been delivered and inducted into service, while another 18 manned aircraft and 8 Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) are being awaited, in 2021/2022. This is in addition to attack boats, patrol vessels, armoured tanks and so on. The Army established ‘Special Mobile Strike Teams’ in the Northeast, while the Air Force has established or is establishing new bases in various parts of the Northwest and North Central (Benue, Nasarawa, Taraba, Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsina). Here is a selection of significant developments that show the progress in Borno State and the Northeast: • El-Kanemi Warriors Football Club returned to their home base in Maiduguri in April 2016, two years after relocating to Katsina State because of the insurgency • Public Secondary Schools resumed in Borno State on Monday September 26, 2016, after two years of closure • Capture of Boko Haram’s operational and spiritual headquarters, “Camp Zero”, in Sambisa Forest, in December 2016. Following this, the Nigerian Army conducted its Small Arms Championship from 26th to 31st March 2017, a measure aimed at enabling the Armed forces to dominate the area, and avoid regrouping by the terrorists. • Chairman of the Christian Association of nigeria (CAN) Borno State Chapter declared the 2017 Easter Celebrations as the best and safest since 2009. • Arik Air resumed flights to Maiduguri in May 2017, three years after suspending operations to the city. • Nigerian Military reopened Maiduguri-Bama-Banki Road in March 2018, four years after it was seized by Boko Haram. • Hundreds of thousands of displaced persons have returned to their homes and communities across the Northeast, since 2015. • Tens of thousands of hostages have been freed from Boko Haram captivity, including 106 of the Chibok Girls abducted in April 2014, and 105 of the Dapchi Girls abducted in February 2018. HIGHLIGHTS OF OPERATION SWIFT RESPONSE (PARTIAL border closure) AUGUST 2019 TO DECEMBER 2020: Operation SWIFT RESPONSE (OSR) which was launched in August 2019 and coordinated by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) has now transformed into nigeria’s Joint border Patrol Team (JBPT) as part of a Tripartite Operation, comprising Benin, Niger and nigeria. • 1,401 irregular migrants arrested Total seizures: • 159,506.7 (50kg) bags of parboiled foreign rice;• 10,447 bags of NPK fertilizer used for making explosives;• 1,974 Vehicles;• 895 motorcycles;• 18,690.3 Jerry cans of Vegetable Oil, among other seized items. • The total monetary value of the apprehended items is about Twelve Billion, Five Hundred and Thirty Eight Million, Three Hundred and Thirty Three Thousand, Five Hundred and Forty Five Naira Fifty Kobo (₦12,538,333,545.50). 2021: NEW NAF BASES COMING TO KATSINA AND GOMBE •       Nigerian Air Force has acquired land to be used for an Operational Base in Gwauruwa Village, Funtua in Katsina State. The new base will translate into increased security coverage and reduced response times for effective air operations against bandits in the area. •       Nigerian Air Force has commenced construction of a Base for its newly-established Unit, the 203 Combat Renaissance Group (203 CRG), in Gombe State. The Base will host some of the NAF’s newly-acquired armed drones (UCAVs). LAUNCH OF OPERATION TURA TAKAIBANGO IN YOBE STATE IN JANUARY 2021: •      Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO was launched by the Military as a subsidiary Operation of Operation LAFIYA DOLE on January 7, 2021. On January 9, 2021, Troops of Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO identified and encircled a Boko Haram ambush site in Gujba LGA of Yobe State, killing 28 Boko Haram Terrorists, destroying one Boko Haram Gun Truck with its occupants while capturing another Gun Truck. Also captured were 2 Anti-Aircraft Guns, 13 AK 47 Rifles, 4 extra magazines and a Vulcanizing Machine. LAUNCH OF EXERCISE “TAIMAKO YAZO”: • The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on 2 January, 2021, conducted a Joint Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), Special Forces (SF) and Air Police K-9 Simulation Exercise (JCSAEX) at Rijana Village along Kaduna-Abuja Highway. • The Exercise, code named “TAIMAKO YAZO”, was aimed at simulating tactics, doctrine and synergy amongst first responders for effective CSAR operations of downed aircrew or other NAF personnel who have had to eject or abandon their aircraft in emergency situations. • The ability to rescue crew from hostile environments is particularly important as it can be adapted for anti-kidnapping operations as was recently done by the NAF in concert with other security agencies in the rescue of all the 344 kidnapped boys of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State. • The Air Force will conduct a total of six of these Exercises between January and June 2021, mostly in the Northwest, particularly in Zamfara and Katsina States.

Additionally, a potential FX adjustment in a bid to ease pressure on the local currency (naira)might possiblyexpand nigeria’s external debt portfolio and total debt stock in year 2021,” the chamber predicts.It projects that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of nigeria (CBN) will be faced with a tough policy choice of boosting economic recovery and tackling inflation this year.Related Story: nigeria’s inflation hits 13.22 per cent, highest since 2018The LCCI expects that oil price and crude production, GDP growth, inflation rate, FX trends, private investment inflows, credit to private sector and domestic interest rates will influence monetary policy direction in the short to medium-term.Inflation in November rose to 14.89 percent from 14.23 percent in October as food prices rose sporadically on border closure and high production cost. Central banks rarely cut the interest rate in periods of high inflation, but investors and small businesses are in search of single-interest funds to expand.READ MORE: https://www.icirnigeria.org/nigerians-to-see-poverty-inflation-debt-worsened-in-2021-lcci/"

563,,,"Despite COVID-19 obstruction, the nigeria Customs Service (NCS) generated the sum of N1,562,115,419,216.32 in the 2020 fiscal year The amount surpassed N1,380,765,353,462 target given the Service and the over N1,342,006,918,504.55 generated in 2019. Customs’ Chief Public Relations Officer, Joseph Attah, confirmed the figure yesterday in a statement.Comptroller-General, Col. Hameed Ali (Rtd), commended the Service for the achievement. An elated Ali attributed the feat to “resolute pursuit of what is right and willingness to adapt to changes brought about by global health challenges occasioned by COVID-19.”The service revenue generation profile has continued to be on the rise yearly as the on-going reforms in the Service insist on strategic deployment of officers strictly using the standard operating procedure; strict enforcement of extant guidelines by the tariff and trade department; automation of the Customs process, thereby eliminating vices associated with the manual process. Other reforms initiated by the Service include robust stakeholder sensitization, resulting in more informed/voluntary compliance and increased disposition of officers and men to put national interest above selves.The partial border closure, which forced cargoes that could have been smuggled through the porous borders to come through the sea and airports, raised revenue collection from the ports. Before the commencement of the border drill on August 20, 2019, revenue generation was between N4 billion and N5 billion, but now, NCS generates between N5 billion and N9 billion daily. Diplomatic engagements that took place during the partial land border closure yielded many positive results, including commitment to comply with the ECOWAS Protocol on Transit Operationalization of joint border patrols at both sides of the border.The teams are required to share intelligence and ensure prevention of transit of prohibited goods into the neighbour’s territory. Accordingly, the Service expressed its readiness to strictly implement the outcome of the diplomatic engagements as the land borders open for movement of cargoes. Intelligence gathered during the period and the introduction of e-Customs, whose components include installation of scanners at all entry points, will enhance border security and boost national trade facilitation. Already, the Ministry of Finance has purchased three new scanners.Interestingly, the Central Bank of nigeria (CBN) has also expressed commitment to purchasing four scanners and establish the control centre for monitoring all scanning sites in their bid to boost national economy, especially agricultural sector.This means that within the next six months, NCS will have about seven functional scanners to be mounted at strategic entry points, even before the full deployment of e-Customs components, which will see to the deployment of 135 modern scanners. Also, the Service’s efforts to prevent the entry of items that could compromise the security of citizens, economy and the well-being of Nigerians resulted in the seizures of 4,304 assorted items with a duty paid value of N28,287,285,847.52. These seizures include arms, ammunition, illicit drugs, used clothing, vegetable oil, frozen poultry and foreign rice, among others, that have grave consequences on the economy, security and well-being of Nigerians."

The Director-General, Manufacturers Association of nigeria (MAN), Segun Ajayi-Kadir, said that 2020 was quite a bad year for the manufacturing business in nigeria, citing the disruption caused by the COVID-19 lockdown and the challenge of insecurity severely limiting food production and movement of food across the country.The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), in its economic review for 2020 and outlook for 2021, noted that the manufacturing sector was faced with several structural challenges, which had an adverse impact on growth performance.The LCCI said the sector had been struggling with growth in recent years due to tough operating conditions in the local business environment and had made most industry players less competitive in the domestic and regional markets.According to the LCCI, lingering forex crisis was perhaps, the most significant challenge for the sector in 2020 as most industry players found it increasingly difficult to access forex meant for importation of critical factor inputs.It said the reopening of the land borders should provide succour to the manufacturing sector just as the kick-off of African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA ), will serve as an avenue for manufacturers to penetrate new African markets.“Critical challenges such as forex scarcity, inconsistent forex policies, inefficient transport infrastructure, high production cost, weak consumer demand and the new competitiveness pressure foisted by the AfCFTA may dampen the recovery prospects of the sector in year 2021.“In our view, credit flows to the manufacturing sector will fail to achieve desired outcomes without putting in place measures to address structural bottlenecks in the ports and customs processes and other policy challenges to productivity.“Thus, we see growth of the manufacturing sector being subdued in the near to medium term,” the LCCI saidhttps://www.ripplesnigeria.com/nigerians-spent-n9-28tn-on-imported-goods-in-nine-months-nbs/."

591,,,"AN overused strategy by the Federal Government to instil order into the chaos at the land borders by closing and reopening them unilaterally lays bare the entrenched superficial method of conducting public affairs in nigeria. Without notice, the ruling regime shut the borders in August 2019, citing the need to curtail the smuggling of rice, arms, cars and frozen foods and protect domestic goods. After much vacillation, four of the borders in the North and South were flung open on December 16. While the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and his team are celebrating the gains of the closure, a close review of the policy reveals wider procedural issues and serious economic losses.Undeniably, the reopening has exhumed old concerns. One, there is evidence that smuggling is still thriving. In the past week, among other reports, nigeria Customs Service officers raided Ayetoro in Ogun State in search of rice smugglers. This led to a fatal clash between them and some youths resulting in injuries and deaths. It suggests that at the end of the lengthy closure, the borders are still porous and dangerous.Officially, there is an air of resignation at the highest level of government about how to secure nigeria’s permeable borders. Buhari laughably hinted at this to his Nigerien counterpart last week, saying “only God can supervise the nigeria-Niger border” of 1,400 kilometres. The national security challenges and the economy make critical thinking on border control imperative. It is acknowledged that the Boko Haram insurgency has been exacerbated by nigeria’s porous borders with Cameroon (1,690 kilometres) in the east, Niger (1,497 kilometres) in the north, Benin (773 kilometres) in the west, and Chad (87 kilometres) in the northeast. Most of these border areas are either mountainous, arid or in the jungle. Parts are ungoverned, seeing little or no government presence.protection and prevention of threats to national security through illegal entry of undesirable persons bent on causing mischief and harm to the country and the protection and prevention of loss of revenue through smuggling and improper filing of trade documents. There is also the protection of the health and well-being of the community through preventing illegal entry of harmful medicinal products and other psychotropic substances. Others are the protection of flora and fauna and preventing entry of the same, which would be detrimental to the agricultural interests of the country and prevention of illegal entry and exit of arms, explosives and other materials of like nature.In extreme cases, cities, kingdoms and nation-states have had reasons to build physical barriers to mark their territory, protect their inhabitants and control who and what enters and exits. The Donald Trump wall is 669 miles of “primary barrier” – the first structure people heading from Mexico to the US will encounter – and 65 miles of “secondary barrier” – which usually runs behind the primary structure as a further obstacle, according to the BBC. These days, technology drives border security. In extreme cases, border closure is not out of place. But in nigeria’s case, not only was the closure sudden, it spanned 16 months, long enough to disrupt the sub-regional trade relations in West Africa and instigate high inflation, according to the Finance Minister, Zainab Ahmed.nigeria evidently gained various benefits during the closure, which must have deluded the government to elongate the closure more than desirable. Among others, the NCS increased its daily income from about N4 billion to more than N5 billion. By mid-December 2020, the joint task force team had seized 1,957 vehicles, 895 motorcycles, 10,447 bags of fertilisers, 18,630 kegs of vegetable oil, 74,307 kegs and 5,653 drums of petrol, 90 pump-action guns and 5,676 cartridges/ammunition worth N12.36 billion.In the modern age, prolonged border closure is a sign of backwardness. It negates international trade, as nigeria is a signatory to the ECOWAS treaty on the movement of goods and services and the African Free Trade Agreement.Buhari should turn things around, infusing the best global border management practices. These days, countries do not close their borders interminably, but put in place efficient solutions to prevent infiltrators. There is no excuse for Customs to be operating manually. Because of this anomaly, contraband and illegal migrants are infiltrating nigeria’s shores: Boko Haram and bandits can still be found with high calibre weapons; smuggled goods seep in uncontrollably through the borders. At the seaports in Lagos, manual operations by Customs is instigating undue delay in cargo clearing. Therefore, the reform should be total, particularly the use of technology, including scanners to detect the movement of contrabands.Currently, there is a high level of distrust between the border communities and the Customs. On the pretext of chasing smugglers, Customs shoot indiscriminately and kill people. This is a crude way of law enforcement. The Customs will be better off preventing goods from entering into the country at the borders rather than running riot in the hinterland and wreaking havoc on the people.Corrupt practices at the country’s borders should be addressed.Effective management of our borders while ensuring security at the same time will facilitate legitimate trade and travel with our neighbours. Well-trained staff and inspection technology are needed to increase border patrols and checkpoint effectiveness. Effective border patrols require constant surveillance by agents, high tech sensors, aircraft, and drones. Public bodies involved in border management should be empowered accordingly to discharge their duties effectively.The Buhari regime should appoint capable leaders to head these agencies. The regime should strike a balance between the encouragement and facilitation of physical movement of persons and goods across the borders while at the same time ensuring that security of the country is not compromised.Source:https://m.punchng.com/Editorial/Now-that-land-borders-are-reopened"

639,,,"Alright!The border was shut towards the end of 2019 primarily to reduce importation and encourage production and patronage of local products. It is also to stall smuggling of contraband items like rice, arms among others. When this policy was made, MAN (that is, Manufacturers Association of nigeria) praised the government, because the development would help them produce and sell more without threats from foreign products.For the government, shutting the border, it was hoped, would boost local production and gear us towards self-sufficiency. However, taking stock of the events that have occurred between then and now, it is not sure if the intended purpose would be achieved simply because of the 'greed' of local producers and suppliers.Now, let's take rice as a case study. Note that rice has been a contraband product for years but was still always finding its way into the country. The foreign rice is far cheaper and, thus, affecting the ability of local producers to sell because they could not compete with foreign rice on the level of quality and price. Therefore, it was a gain for local rice producers when the border was totally shut.But, unfortunately, what the border closure has done, at best, is to foster an increase in production and sales of local rice. It did not stop the price of rice from skyrocketing to a level that a common man can no longer afford. In other words, the policy did not better the lot of the masses, even though the government had good intentions. I blame local producers and suppliers whose greed and to posture to  'have it all now' brought the policy to disrepute. The border closure was their chance to penetrate and gain the local market with quality and fairly-priced products but they missed it.I will not blame the government if the reopening of the border affects the business of MAN because they did not help the government to prove that the border closure was good. Federal Government cannot continue to take insults and curses from the masses for the border closure while some sections of MAN continue to use the instance of the policy to milk Nigerians.As the border reopens, I expect the quantity of foreign rice finding its way into the country to massively increase and this will crash the price of a bag of rice in the market. Many local producers will lose businesses. I expect suppliers to divert into the supply of foreign products. So, in the end, it is local producers that will lose."

As you can see, when the border was closed they introduced Joint border Patrol which comprises of Army, Immigration, Police and Customs.“Anytime they ask us to open the border, we will open it,” he said.NAN also reports that movement restrictions and checking of goods and vehicles remained in place at more than 20 checkpoints mounted by Customs, Immigration and Police along Badagry Expressway.Also, commercial activities were yet to pick up at the Seme market due to the continued closure of the border.Mrs Funke Senapon, a trader at the popular Seme market, appealed to Federal Government to order the officials to reopen the border. She said that residents and traders who were rejoicing about the news of the reopening were disappointed when they discovered that border had not been opened.NAN reports that the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, on Wednesday announced the immediate reopening of four land borders after the Federal Executive Council meeting held virtually in Abuja.The Federal Government had on August 21, 2019, ordered the closure of Nigerian borders to curb smuggling of goods and weapons.“The president has approved the reopening of four land borders, namely– Seme, South-West, Ilela, North West, Maigatari border in the North-West and North-Central and Mfum in the South-South.“These four land borders will be opened immediately, while the remaining land borders are directed to be reopened on or before Dec. 31,’’ the minister told State House Correspondents in Abuja on Wednesday.She said that Buhari also directed that while the borders were being reopened, the ban on the importation of rice, poultry and other products still subsisted and would be implemented by the border patrol team.Source:https://m.guardian.ng/News/Seme-border-remains-closed-24-hours-after-FG-order"

675,,,"Insecurity: One Week, One Trouble!By Abdullahi D MohammedOne week, One trouble, this line aptly captures the pathetic and sorry state of insecurity in nigeria, especially in the North. In the aftermath of the Zabarmari massacre, the outcry and condemnation emanating from different  quarters, one would expect  the Federal Government get a little  more proactive rather  than  the usual reactionary stand that had long characterized  their leadership style.Once faced with any unfortunate calamity -- terrorist and bandits attacks, Government's Spokespersons reel out traditional condemnation, condolences and sometimes  engage in an outright blame-game. These traits are sadly, what has come to define  the government as a reactionary  instead of precautionary. A serious and more concerned government  would identify  or delineate  high risk state which are prone to attacks in all region or zones in the country. In Europe and other  developed economies, policy makers and security operational categorize  security threats, its severity and levels in such variables  like category Green or low, which simply means the threats are low, while Blue, means the threats and risk are high, and Red, which portends the severity and danger as very high. That said, states in Northwest, particularly Katsina and Zamfara which had lately  become the hotbed of banditry and senseless killings should come top of the list. Disparagingly, the government is giving lip service to the fight against insurgency and other criminality in the country. To buttress this point,  security operatives had falled to identify high risk spots in these troubled states, which would include, but not limited  to schools, hospitals communities and markets. Had the security operatives been up and doing in these states, they probably would  have foiled or, prevented the abduction  of about 800 Students in Government Science Secondary School in Kankara, Katsina state, last Friday.There were however, conflicting reports on the actual number, but, that does not invalidate the failure  of security operatives at a time the C-in-C is on a state visit to his home state.Although, two-hundred out of the nearly 800 abducted students had surreptitiously fled their  abductors and returned home, the fate of the remaining captives are still largely unknown. So far, Governor Aminu Masari had ordered the closure of all boarding schools across the state, which is necessary,but sad,as yet again education is threatened.Apparently, relying  on government  for protection against attacks is not longer feasible. The Buhari led Federal government and security operatives had been overwhelmed by security challenges and has obviously run out of ideas. Within same period, there are reports of early morning attacks in Askira Uba, In Borno state, and, killings in Benue state between farming communities and Gunmen. Nigerian Government is fighting an unconventional warfare, which,  equally requires unconventional tact in tandem with present realities, especially in the area of intelligence, and technology.  Terrorism and insecurity are global phenomenon,  but, we have seen how nations that prioritize security contained the monster and reduce the preponderance of such attacks using intelligence  and technology. After the abduction  of chibok school girls, a governmnent serious about security  will not hesitate to provide unconventional  security in all Secondary  schools  in troubled states plagued  by insurgency. If fighting an unconventional  guerilla-like warfare is complex, technology  had long demystify that nation. For instance, installing gadgets like CCTV, 24hrs UAV drones  and other surveillance  equipments would do a perfect job twenty security  opertives can't.The pattern, and modes of operations adopted by these gunmen are known, they repeatedly use same format, how they usually get away with it is baffling.Which is why, the call for  the removal of Service Chiefs has been amplified recently  due in part to the  endless killings and the seeming inability of those responsible for our security.As it were, their tactics must take a different  shape and dimension. The bloodletting has asssumed  an insane  and dangerous dimension  right under the President's nose. At this  point, however, it has become imperative and incumbent on us all to hold accountable not only the President, but his handlers and minions  who had visibly taken firm control of his persona and dictate the policy direction of the adminstration. In the aftermath of Zabarmari attacks, the House of Representatives summoned the President to appear before it, which he acceded to, and a date was fixed, out of the blue, the Attorney-general of the federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami told Nigerian astonished  Nigerians the President  won't honour the invitation citing the unconstitutionality of such summons. While I'm not in the legal profession to ascertain the constitutionalily or otherwise of such summons, flipping  through sections 88-89 of the constitution affirmed so,  by giving  powers to the Reps to summon  public officers holders, if needs be. Consciously, constitutional  or not, the  President, in his capacity  as the chief  security  officer  of the land, the C-in-C, has the moral obligation  to speak on insecurity in the land,  and what better platform than the National  Assembly which act as representatives of 200million plus Nigerians.The visit,  if anything would have provided the avenue  to evaluate the achievements or otherwise, to make inputs and explore what needs to be done, when, how, and where.The session  would have been productive.Those who persuaded the President to rescind his decision to honour the invitation did a great disservice to Nigerian and robbed us to the opportunity to have C-in-C speak on the more  topical issue -- insecurity. Buhari's minions are the greatest culprit and beneficiaries of insecurity through war merchandising, and could be responsible for the abduction of students of GSSS, kankara and other parts of the country! It is safe, to say however that, nigeria is at war, or state of war, but solely with itself. The continued  rentention of the Service Chiefs had cost, and unfortunately shall continue to, cost nigeria the war! Had the President set out an order or target to the chiefs -- restore normalcy or get fired; insecurity would have abated at least to a more appreciable level. Grandstanding by the  Generals and administration officials in the face of insecurity has proven Nigerian  is on autopilot, as most are  cashing out heavily while thousands die in the hands of terrorist almost on a daily basis.  In a community in Zamfara, people pay their way into staying alive. Monies are payed as tax to known bandits by these communities in exchange for exemption from attacks. Same goes for farmlands -- pay money and access to your fields or, get ambushed, kidnapped or attacked. Which serious nation does that,  which nation relegates the  security and lives of its citizens for partisan politics and other monetary inducements/motivations in veiled corruption? And, how does a serious competent C-in-C, tolerated and allow these anomalies thrive?It is over nine months, and no end in sight to the ASUU strike. Only last week, the ASUU-FG delegations announced it has suspended indefinitely, negotiations owing to distrust and insincerity on the part of government. Sadly, a chunk of nigeria's challenges especially security is hinged on lack of education and access to practical teaching tools and training, which ASUU has been harping on. Most of those who engage in kidnappings, are unfortunately, youths of productive age, whom might have been engaged in productive ventures had they had access to education.Deprioritising education has been this government's undoing which, would ultimately consume her.Only recently, the Minister of Education, Mal Adamu Adamu, was quoted to have said many Nigerian graduates cannot read or write, this revelation further affirmed what most stakeholders and ASUU had been agitating for -- a total overhaul of the education policy and budgetary allocation to the sector. So long as the sector continue to suffer neglect, Nigerian tertiary institutions would continue to churn out unproductive class of graduates adding to an array of uninformed population.With nigeria's population projected to hit 205.87 million at the end of 2020, the last thing the Government would want is an unproductive and uninformed population. China remains the most populous country in the world, and pride herself of such for the simple reasons it has a very productive population which are visible in all spheres -- Technology, Education, Trade and investment. nigeria must take drastic measures to make education a focal point of its policy.At the moment, the country is officially in recession, the second in the life of this administration, the World Bank cited Covid-19 pandemic and border closure as some of the factors responsible. But, that is not all, the level of malfeasance by government officials had further depleted the treasury making government borrow to fund capital projects, it 7 and other services. Budget padding, which is an advanced or disguised method known as legislative looting is well in practice and all arms of government are culpable. In the just concluded budget defense by MDAs, weird and mind boggling figures were sneaked into budgetary allocations by officials  sometimes,  in cahoot with lawmakers. Recently, the Petroleum Ministry was said to have spent a whopping N166 million on the purchase of pen, tonners, stationeries and letterhead in 2015. The level of impunity in this administration is appalling, sharp practices is tolerated. Jobs, especially federal civil service are ups for grabs for the highest bidder. Government jobs/slots goes for about a million naira or more, depending on the parastatal or agency. It is usually, the juicier the slot, the higher the price. And this is happening right under the nose of the APC-led administration, which pride Itself as fighting corruption.To say this administration had lost its bearing is stating the obvious, it has failed to provide the most fundamental need of its citizens -- security and peaceful atmosphere. Similarly, other amenities like power supply is still erratic, while, pump price of fuel is astonishingly high.Faced with an impending famine and food shortage, the response and approach of government is most vague and capricious. No clear cut blueprint to address the looming danger, its focus is solely on 2023.National security by far outweighs any 2023 political intrigues, because, lives and properties must be secured first, and voters has to be alive to a vote, in 2023. Should we adopt the culture of silence in the face of daunting insecurity? Chances are, bandits and terrorist will take over, gradually territories we consider comfort zone. We must not allow government's complacency and whimsicality drive us to abyss. We must hold government accountable and demand our inalienable right to life, as it seems, that right is threatened by rampaging gunmen.The recklessness and  insensitivity of our leaders is legendary. Weeks after the Zabarmari massacre, nigeria's Army chief whom should have since relocated to the Northeast was teeing off, unconcerned, in a posh Golf course in Abuja, at a time thousands could not sleep, peacefully at their homes across  Northern nigeria. The President is either unaware or, has zero empathy, whichever way, as citizens, we must take the bull by the Horn and do things differently. Government cannot protect us, the worsening insecurity has shown little sign of abating, rather, the terrorist are getting emboldened by day.Thankfully, Katsina state has taken the lead by peacefully protesting, which is means of sending message to unresponsive leaders. The #Endsars protest had proven that collectively, as a people, and with strong will and the right approach, we can bend our leaders to do our bidding. President Buhari and his band of security operatives are not infallible, we must rise and demand an end to insecurity in the North, and nigeria, in general. We owe it to thousands of  those that died recklessly  due to the incompetence of this administration. Failure to do so, is akin to surrendering our existence to both government and gun men.nigeria is not the only country battling insurgency, in the West African Sub region, countries like Mali and Niger Republic, had their share of attacks, but, these are isolated cases, not a traditional weekly attacks as seen in nigeria. These countries had confronted the terrorist headlong. Earlier in the year, Nigerien President, Mouhmadou Yousofo sacked his Army chief when terrorist killed of 75 of its soldiers.On a flipside, soldiers who complained and demanded for accountability in the fight against terrorism are axed in nigeria.For how long as a nation can we continue to condone weekly carnage and, the attendant condolences and condemnation by our leaders? We must say it as it is, any discerning mind who thinks this administration has solutions to myriad of problems or challenges is hallucinating and living in self denial. The onus is on us, to take charge albeit peacefully, and by democratic means to get, or force our leaders take charge and confront the challenges.Because at the moment, it seems the country is on a free fall without any central authority to take control. If we had responsive leadership, we won't await the next likely sad news which had become a recurrent weekly episode in nigeria. In Katsina, Students that returned home from their captors were not rescued by the combined security operatives, rather they found a survival strategy which they groped fervently and escaped. A very weak attempt by the Federal Government to reduce the number of Students still missing was rebuffed by the Katsina Governors who staunchly disagree that only 10 students are in captivity.As citizens, we must also activate same  survival strategy and demand a true change, away from the status quo and chart a new path to end the senseless killings of our fellow citizens in the North,and other part of the country. Failure to do so, God-forbid, we shall keenly await the next sad and unfortunate episode, which has become the "" One week, One trouble""  feature, in nigeria. We pray, for the safe return of both chibok girls and, GSSS, Kankara, Katsina state.Abdullahi D Mohammed is with the Department of Political Science and International Studies at the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, He writes from Kanoabdullahkidnyce@gmail.com"

677,,,"“We are depressed, very depressed. And anyone of us, of our age, who was not depressed, he was not well-born, because we have nothing to leave behind for our children, and violence will not sustain us…”  —  Chief Audu Ogbeh, Chairman, Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF.Ogbeh, former Minister of Communications under President Shagari and of Agriculture under Buhari from 2015 to 2019, was wrong. His generation of Northerners actually left several awful things behind for their children. One of them is a devastated poultry industry and its repercussions. Ogbeh actually contributed to that problem during his years as Buhari’s Minister. Indeed, if the President is asked to name those who helped to bring his administration to the point where the hitherto supportive ACF, are now “depressed, very depressed”, Audu Ogbeh should be top on the list of culprits. Here is why.When in 2016, Fulani herdsmen invaded Agatu, Benue State, and slaughtered over 100 people and rendered thousands homeless, Ogbeh, though Minister representing Benue State, did not visit the place; neither did the Federal Government, FG, he served, send relief materials.The raid on Agatu was followed by the massacre of people in more Benue communities until Governor Ortom rose in defence of his people. When the FG finally reacted, it was to blame the victimised people of Benue for not accommodating strangers. It was a bloody lie and Ogbeh knew the truth. But, hanging on to his portfolio as Minister was more important than standing up for the truth and his people.READ ALSO:Troops have surrounded kidnappers of Katsina students, says Garba ShehuEven when the Mayetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, MACBAN, and various officials of the FG proclaimed untruths about the mass murders in Benue and threatened the people, Ogbeh uttered not a word. Instead he joined others in promoting RAGU — the forceful establishment of grazing lands in all the states of nigeria – in total defiance of the Land Use Decree 1978, which vested all state lands in the Governors of each state. Herdsmen, urged on by MACBAN, went on unchecked rampage from state to state destroying farms.Unfortunately for the MACBAN, FG and Ogbeh, they were all too myopic to realise that maize and soybeans are two of nigeria’s most important crops. Rice is the third. But, maize and soybeans, apart from constituting direct food items are absolutely indispensable as inputs for poultry feed. It never occurred to them that cattle cannot distinguish between maize farms and others. In fact, they have preferences for maize and beans farms. I learnt this fact by accident in 2018.Travelling from Minna to Bida and on my way to Lagos, I opted to go by a longer route: Minna-Zungeru- Wushishi-Badeggi-Bida. I wanted to visit an old friend in a community in Wushishi Local Government. There, a compelling story unfolded. The people in these areas are not Fulani or Hausa. Apparently, since 2016, thousands of small and medium scale farmers have been experiencing repeated invasions of their rice, beans and maize farms by Fulani herdsmen. Hitherto, the shepherds were not armed. But, starting middle 2016, they were armed with guns. And, unlike time immemorial, when cattle incursion into farms was settled amicably, herdsmen became intransigent. Reports to the police and security people in the area fell on deaf ears.By 2018, Fulani herdsmen, previously living in relative obscurity among other Nigerian tribes, had emerged as one of the five most deadly terrorist groups worldwide. Wherever terrorists enter, it is their cardinal intention to deprive all others of their rights to lives, means of livelihood, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. They bring destruction everywhere including Niger State.  More maize, rice and beans farms were destroyed as herdsmen became more emboldened.Around the early part of 2017, the first reports of kidnapping of farmers and family – after invading and destroying the farm – started to emerge. By 2018, what most communities in that axis of Niger State had regarded as a rumour had become a fact. The Fear of herdsmen, previously docile, now aggressive and imperialistic was the beginning of wisdom.It was the beginning of a sustained attack against maize, rice and beans farmers across Niger State – which left several thousand farms fallow this year. The widespread attitude is: why bother to plant if cattle will destroy some and bandits will seize the rest? Niger State, it might be added, is capable of producing more maize, rice and beans than Lagos, Ogun, Osun, Ondo and Ekiti combined.From information available to me, hundreds of thousands of women and girls – who constitute the backbone of Nigerian agriculture – don’t go to farm anymore. Meanwhile, the young men have taken two routes out of the farm. Some have joined the rural-urban drift and are so far away from farmland that they can be presumed to be lost forever to farming. The second batch has gone to swell the ranks of criminals – kidnappers, bandits and cattle rustlers. The last group (rustlers) are out for revenge on herdsmen who forced them off the farm. Being idle, they easily found employment with the devil – who loves idle hands. The rest of the country will pay dearly for all these.One of Ogbeh’s contributions to our present predicament is discussed below.border closure and its consequences“You burn the house to roast the pig. It was always the only way mankind roasted pigs.” – Saul Bellow.Many Nigerians cannot wait for May 29, 2019 to come. It will relieve them of one public servant who has become more of a public danger than all the others put together. The man is Chief Audu Ogbeh who I had tipped as one of the most likely to succeed among Buhari’s Ministers. Don’t blame me totally.First, readers would recollect the proposal to establish several “Cattle Colonies” in all the states of nigeria. The uproar that greeted that idea lasted several months until the President was forced to disclaim it.”Then he announced that: “Our other problem is smuggling. As we speak, a neighbour of ours is importing rice than China is importing. They do not eat parboiled rice; they eat white rice and they are using their port to try and damage our economy.” – Chief Audu Ogbeh.Ogbeh’s recommendation is playing itself out now. The statement credited to him was followed by an appeal to the FG to close Nigerian borders on account of imported and smuggled rice. The FG closed the border. Let us quickly point out that foreign rice is still entering nigeria. More importantly, I pointed out then that rice was not the only commodity crossing the border; it would stop export of Nigerian goods to ECOWAS as well. But, Ogbeh is a fanatic. Only God knows how much of our current recession can be attributed to loss of exports to ECOWAS. Now the FG is in a dilemma. The adverse consequences of border closure have dawned on them. We are stuck with the results of a stupid policy.Finally, he was also in support of the ban placed on maize imports. Two months ago, the FG quietly issued selective import licences to few maize importers – who will make windfall profits while Nigerians pay more for poultry products and poultry farmers fold up.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/12/how-macban-herdsmen-and-fg-devastated-poultry-sector/amp/"

He spoke on the floor of the lower legislative chamber following the adoption of a motion sponsored by another representative from Katsina, Sada Soli, for the NCS to lift ban on the supply of petroleum products to land border stations within 20 kilometres of Nigerian borders. The lawmaker, who condemned the unilateral directive by the Comptroller General of Customs to ban the supply of petroleum products within 20 kilometres to the country’s land borders, lamented the hardship people in his constituency and others living in the border communities were going through as a result of the policy.He said there is need to summon the Customs boss to explain to Nigerians the rationale behind the decision to ban sale of petroleum products within 20 kilometres to the country’s border.He said, “I was ambushed by the committees in Daura due to the hardship they are facing there as a result of the closure of the border and ban on supply of fuel within 20 kilometres on instruction given by the Customs. “From Daura to Kongolam, which is the international border, it is just 18 kilometres, in fact from Mr President’s house, even his bedroom to the border is just 13 kilometres.

697,,,"Agricultural experts have come together to put forward a lasting solution to the low supply of food and loss of agricultural produce due to lack of solid cold chain practice in nigeria.The call was made during the 8th Annual Conference of the Brand Journalists’ Association of nigeria which was held recently at Sojourner By Genesis Hotel, GRA Ikeja. with the theme Consolidating nigeria’s Agricultural Revolution: Challenges, Opportunities and LessonsWhile declaring the event opened, the president of BJAN, Princewill Ekwujuru said the body decided to shift slightly from core issues in the world of brands and marketing to an area the association felt it can stir up the possibility of jump-starting the much desired industrialization nigeria needs, for her economic development, especially in this times of recession.In Ekujuru’s words, “Our focus on Agriculture this year is motivated by the passion to deepen discussions in an area we believe can extensively provide answers to the endless calls for the diversification of our economy and create big brands across all touch-points of its long value chain.Speaking on the importance of cold chain system, Mr Tunde Okoya, president, Organisation of Technology Advancement of Cold Chain West Africa OTACCWA in his presentation titled Developing Blue Print for Advancement of Cold Chain in nigeria outlined the reasons why cold chain is the escape route to the loss of food production and wastage in nigeria.According to him, over 15 million metric tons of nigeria perishable farms produces are lost annually due to poor logistics infrastructure and high cost of transportation which leads to spoilage. He maintained that cold chain which is a series of action apply to maintain produce within a specific low temperature range from harvest to consumption is one of the reasons his organisation, OTACWAS is established to reduce post harvests loss, poor nutrition, poor hygiene and poor food safety. He added that over 14 million malnutrition children are in nigeria due to poor food hygiene and safetyIn his words. “According to FAO, post-harvest loss of many agric product in nigeria could be as high as 50% so invariably, a lot of production by our farmer goes into waste along the value chain and that cannot be a very productive way for any country. So, the result of this is poor earnings for the farmers, poor nutrition for the children, and poor hygiene for the country. nigeria is ranked 98 out of 107 countries in the global hunger index majorly because of this.“The problem is that, even though we are producing a lot, a large percentage of the production is going into waste. With an effective cold chain policy, Agriculture in nigeria will soar to greater heights”.He said with the availability of cold chain, there will be reduction on post harvest loss, good earnings by farmers, increase in food nutrition and food safety.Also speaking at the event, Mr Segun Atho,  National Deputy President, Rice Farmers Association of nigeria said that farmers in nigeria are facing lot of difficulties either from the government or the community. In his words, ‘’This year is another disaster in history. From Coronavirus to bandit, we are facing a lot of challenges’’. He added that farmers have ran away from the farm due to insecurity especially in the northern part of the country where bandits are requesting money from farmers before they harvest their produce.Mr Atho who was displeased with some government policies said government are mostly concerned about data without implementation,. ‘’it is time nigeria move away from data presentation to proper workshop, enough of paper works’’ he said.He called on the government to involve farmers in making their policies, give farmers access to finance and help in production technologies.Also commenting, Mr. Sakin Agbeyewa, Deputy Chairman of Lagos state All Farmers Association of nigeria, who represented his chairman Femi Oke stressed that nigeria’s agricultural sector needs a lot of subsidy, not just in form of cash to farmers but through the provision of a conducive atmosphere.In his words, “The subsidy we are calling for is not in form of cash to our members. The subsidy we want is ready- to- plant lands. By clearing bush for our members, by helping us interface with all types of land owners who gather to disturb during planting and harvesting period. In the northern part, farmers are being preventing from going to farms  to harvest their crops by terrorists that are forcing them to heavy dues for them to access their farms products, subsidy is also in form of provision of bulldozers for land, swamp-dozers for swampy areas, provision of food preservers for perishable products.”On the issue of bother closure, Mr Sakin said it wasn’t the right time for the government to open the border when nigeria farmers have invested heavily on planting their product which will spell doom for them because of prize war with imported rice produce. He advised the government to protect the local people even if the border is opened.He maintained that agriculture is a multi-million dollar investment if the government focus on it.Another speaker, Mr Richard Mark Mbaram, Senior Special Adviser to Minister of Agriculture on Communication called on journalists to hold government accountable to the citizenry.Mbaram speaking through a representative,Mr Steve Ogboko said there is need to challenge government policies which they have made but not put into practise. He wondered why media practitioners often accept things without making efforts to get into details of such announcements in order to make government stand firm on their policies.Describing Anchor Borrower programme introduced by Central Bank of nigeria (CBN) as one of the programmes which journalists should bring their interrogative minds to bear, he reminded journalists that the general public often rely on what journalists feed them.He said, “most of those programmes on agricultural developments are only heard on pages of newspapers or on the television screens while the direct farmers are not aware of such funds or any subsidy released for farmers.“Who are the people that benefited from all those things announced by government for farmers?” he asked.The 2020 conference which was the first hybrid event by BJAN was moderated by Kayode Olagesin, Managing Director/CEO, TownCriers Ltd.Also at the event, awards were given to deserving brands and individuals who have contributed to the growth and development of the marketing communications industryhttps://www.brandcrunch.com.ng/2020/12/08/experts-proffer-solutions-to-improve-food-production-through-cold-chain-subsidy-at-bjan-conference/"

701,,,"The current cement unit price is not a demand pulled inflation as spyder880 said. I have said this on this forum before; the current situation regarding cement is a fall out of the very poor management of the foreign exchange policy by the CBN. This is what is going on:It should be recalled that the Federal Government gave a concession to Dangote and BUA to export cement to Niger Republic despite the border closure. Now ask yourselves, why Niger Republic; why Cement in particular. What is the attraction of Niger Republic and Cement? But how is this related to the current hike in price and the exchange rate of the Naira? I will try and explain in a simple term.The black market rate of the Naira dictates the economic trend in the country. We know that the Naira has again fallen in value dangerously to all international currencies. Now the cement companies including the biggest player (Dangote) are still producing at the 'old' rate of the Naira and as already said by some contributors here, still selling at the 'old' factory gate price. From history, we know that the cement companies will soon adjust the factory gate price of cement in line with the now dangerous rate of the Naira. This happens all the time the Naira is devalued. Note that when Dangote trailer leaves the factory gate, that trailer load of 600 bags is no longer Dangote's, although it is on Dangote's branded trailer. The 600 bags have already been paid for by the dealer about two or even three months ago. The cement companies are just fulfilling the forward contract. The cement dealers know that Dangote and the rest will soon adjust their prices. The current price (N4,200) the dealers are selling now is a speculative anticipatory price to accommodate the eventual increase by the cement companies and a mechanism to stay in business. What does this mean? Be patient.At the 'old' price (for example) of  2,550 Naira (the wholesale price 600 bags) the dealer needs about 1,470,000 Naira to fulfill an order of a trailer load. If Dangote now increases the price, the dealer will need more Naira to fulfil the same order (trailer load). So what dealers are doing now is selling at a speculative price to accommodate any increase in price so that they can continue trading. If they don't sell at a higher price now, they will not have enough money to fulfil a trailer load when the factory price goes up. If the factory price goes up.Now the Niger Republic connection. The Naira has been drastically devalued which means nigeria cement is cheaper to dealers in Niger Republic. Demand from Niger Republic must have gone up. What is now happening is nigeria dealers are now diverting (fulfilling Niger Republic order) to Niger Republic to earn foreign exchange leaving the home (nigeria) market panting for breath. This also happens with cross border trade with petrol. This should explain the scarcity in the country. Someone or some people are benefiting from the deliberately imposed chaos. Why Niger Republic? Why cement? Stability will return after Dangote and the cement companies announce the new adjusted price or stick to the 'old' price. As part of Dangote Social Corporate Responsibility (SCR), as the market leader should come out with a statement on the current situation to calm things down and issue assurances to dealers regarding any new factory gate price. This is the responsible thing to do. I'm not expecting cement to go back to the old price.I have tried accessing Dangote Cement website to see if there is any statement in this regard and to send them a message but the website (surprisingly) is not working. If the website is working for you let us know."

A simple question will then be why we've had over twenty years of consistent deficit budgeting but have had recession only twice.Your growth representation of nigeria's economy which you used to buttress your claim is factually wrong.During the Abacha years, nigeria's GDP grew steadily from 1.9 in 1995 to 4.1 in 1996 and maintained above 2 points growth in 97-98.Also, from 1999-2003, we had explosive growth peaking at 14.6 in 2002 and none of those was ever less than 5 points. Go check the oil price in those periods. None ever climbed above $30. As a matter of fact, it was during the Iraq war that oil rose above $60!! It's this bit of history that's always made me not buy that so-called break-even price cause I see it as a tacit absolving of the govt from its responsibilities. Any wonder this came up during this recessionist govt?Note also that your quest for a surplus budget is not a cure for our economic malady at all. Achieving a surplus budget is quite simple in fact. Print more money and cut down on capital expenditures and voila your surplus budget is here!! The question will be to what end. I'll share a piece written on this recession for you so you can see the direct nexus between economic policies and GDP, the biggest culprit being the border closure maintained amidst rising inflation. Right now, economists have come to accept where in stagflation.Just as the first recession was more about Forex and not just fall in oil price as this govt has come to make people believe.And yes. I agree the CBN governor does not control how much dollar comes into nigeria but he can control how dollar leaves and by that stymie the effect of dollar availability on our economy. The problem though is that we have a pliant governor who knows where his good standing with govt functionaries come from and is not prepared to sabotage that cosy relationship.Funny you support deregulation and liberal policies and also support a CBN governor who is conservative and protectionist in outlook.

763,,,"The All Farmers Association of nigeria, AFAN, on Monday, expressed worry over rising food prices and crisis across the country occasioned by several factors.The National President, AFAN, Arc Kabir Ibrahim, in a chat with Vanguard described the astronomical rise in food prices as scary and daunting.According to Ibrahim, it is next to impossible to import food from anywhere else in addition to the economic recession rearing its head in nigeria today.Some of the factors that led to the stupendous rise in food prices include the impact of insecurity, novel Coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic, flood crisis, poor attention to farmers, #EndSARS protest, fuel pump price hike, high electricity tariff, dilapidated roads, and increased taxation.He said: “It is quite scary and daunting especially when it is next to impossible to import food from anywhere else in addition to the economic recession rearing its head in nigeria today.“As an interim measure, the farmers must be supported with good seeds and inputs to upscale dry season farming to augment their rain-fed production.“The Federal Ministry of Water Resources should also complete and expand the dams as well as irrigation schemes abandoned for a very long time.”However, he accused the leadership of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development for being part of the food crisis as they failed to carry farmers along in its policies and also pointed that some State Governments are not really paying attention to farmers and food production as they fail to walk the talk in that regard.“The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development should be reappraised to function better as the present leadership is clearly short-sighted and incompetent.“State Governments should be more involved in agriculture as some of them are not walking the talk at all”, he stated.Meanwhile, he acknowledged that “The Government did its best in supporting farmers through the Central Bank of nigeria, CBN, Anchor Borrower Programme but the targeted farmers are only about 2 million which is definitely a far cry from the 14.5 million farmers in the Government register.”He also assured that AFAN will do all within its ability through advocacy to ensure smallholder farmers who are the engine-room of food production get what they deserve in order to boost food production, availability, accessibility and affordability.“AFAN is continually involved in advocacy to attract support for the Smallholder farmers who are the engine room of production but faces some antagonism from the current Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.“While we are always urging farmers to assiduously work to bring about food sufficiency we believe that the CBN Anchor Borrower Programme will be more effective if it reached genuine farmers by being channelled through AFAN”, he added.Speaking on intervention by development partners in the current food crisis that was earlier predicted the AFAN boss said where they are majorly needed is the up-scaling capacity of farmers.“The Development partners will impact the food system more if they upscale their capacity-building support to the SHFs across the board through AFAN”, he said.On the current land border closure and biting high cost of food, which some Nigerians are calling for opening order to allow food importation in the bid to tackle the current food crisis in the country, he (Ibrahim) said that option could be more devastating as it would compound the crisis, and also negatively impact the nation’s security.“We must be careful not to attract an influx of refugees and uncoordinated outflow of our scarce food items if the borders are wide-open”, he stated.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/11/afan-expresses-worry-over-rising-food-prices-crisis/amp/"

Your example with the UK and US about dividing/joining ppl together is just as confused and stupid as your earlier comment above.The letter 'U' in UK & US stands for the word UNITED; in case of the former, United Kingdom, made of about 4 nationalities: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; while in the case of latter it stands for United States, which is composed of 50 confederating states; made up of predominantly immigrants from Europe (Hispanics & African Americans) who were land grabbers that stole the land and nearly exterminated all the true indigenous Americans i.e. Red Indians - therefore note the Americans of today are different ppl living together in one united country. Furthermore, contrary to your position; the ppl of Worcestershire and Stafford shire (2 counties in England) are already joined together with the Irish (as already mentioned) under one entity as the United Kingdom a.k.a UK.Lastly, the truth is that nigeria's borders are quite porous, including those in the south; the said closure is merely technical because immigration and customs alone cannot physically control the movement of ppl and goods between the country and her neighbours; on top of that, personnel of the mentioned agencies often accept bribes and permit brisk illegal activities between border points under their control - this is happening everywhere; southerners like you are just hypocritically crying wolf and pointing at the north while deliberately ignoring their own."

Read carefully and pay attention.In the first place, the amount of fuel to be imported from Niger is largely inconsequential in the grand scheme of fuel consumption in nigeria. This means there is no real benefit for nigeria in the exchange. This is more in the light of the fact that like I've already told you, Niger sells fuel at N350 while we sell at N170. So how exactly will Niger be incentivized to sell fuel to nigeria? I'm waiting for you to see the abracadabra and insincerity of the govt you're supporting. I don't want to have to spell the word myself.

If we talk, these Fulani herdsmen will kill us like goats. Recently, they killed a father, his wife and three children in Oja-Odan, Yewa North. This is getting too much and nobody is doing anything about it,” Olamilekan lamented.In his words, the former Chairman of Imeko-Afon Local Government, Hon. Tosin Adeluyi, called on the Federal Government to see to the development of border areas, saying the agency put in charge of that responsibility has not been doing anything in Ogun State.Adeluyi said unemployment is the root cause of all social vices, and charged governments at all levels to keep the youths off the streets by getting them gainfully employed.Responding, the Minister assured the people that their requests would get to the President.Adegbite said government would not rest until the excesses of customs officers in Ogun and nigeria in general are addressed.According to him, officers of the NCS need to be sensitised, stressing that “it is far better for a smuggler to escape than to kill an innocent soul.”He revealed that the population of the nation is growing faster than the nation’s revenue, urging all Nigerians to be productive.https://dailypost.ng/2020/11/21/fulani-herdsmen-customs-officers-killing-us-like-goats-ogun-residents-tell-buhari/"

783,,,"Folks, its beyond serious ooh       onion is now gold in nigeria. see hungry nigerian Father Chrismas     una go see rice chop this christmas soooo      Nigerian Onion, ’new gold’, as food prices skyrocket   November 16, 2020254 views0 comments By Charles Abuede In the September 2020 inflation report, the food index rose by 0.66 basis points to 16.66 per cent. In August it was 16 per cent; and as a major driver of headline inflation, the surge was accrued to rising food prices occasioned by border closures and weakening of the Nigerian currency, the naira, against the dollar in the foreign exchange market,as well as the incessant flooding in the northern region of nigeria where most agricultural produce is cultivated.As the nation’s official statistics office – the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), is set to release official inflation figure for the month of October this week and Nigerian households begin to fasten their belts in preparation for the 2020 Yuletide season, many are again, faced with the realization of having to buy food commodities at a robust price – a tradition which is fast becoming a twelve-monthly ritual for Nigerians.It is against this backdrop that Business A.M. decided to make a detailed observation of the trending prices in nigeria’s commodities markets and we found that the price of onions, one of the commonly used vegetables in nigeria, has taken a huge spike that has left the produce scarcely available, thereby turning it into the ‘new gold’ of this yuletide season.Business A.M. learnt that the scarcity and the high prices, when they are found, have left many concerned, forcing them to question the circumstances that have brought this on them, especially with the suddenness of the price hike, put at 200 percent and above, leading some to ask if this was not unconnected with the recent upheavals in the economy.While traders and consumers lament over the scarcity and the price increase,questions are being asked by all and sundry as to the real reasons behind the increase in the price of Nigerian onion.When Business A.M. commodities desk made effort to seek answers from its network of farmers and produce trading analysts, we found that this significant price increase was precipitated by the poor harvest and poor storage facilities, the disruptions brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the recent flooding which eroded several farmlands in the north.Within the last couple of years, which have seen the government shutting the land borders  and also restricting the importation of about 48 items that could be locally produced, with the intention of curbing smuggling and encouraging local production, prices of other agricultural commodities, such as rice, cassava and other locally produced commodities have been on a persistent increase. This is a situation that has elicited reactions from various quarters to question the essence of the continuing border closure which, on the other hand, was supposed to be a way forward; but is now clearly contributing to the hike in prices and inflation.Equally, in the September 2020 inflation report from the country’s headline inflation was said to have accelerated for the thirteenth straight month, jumping from 13.2 per cent in August to 13.7 per cent in September while the core inflation climbed to 10.6 per cent, from 10.5 per cent in the previous month.What then lies ahead for this important economic indicator for the month of October, coming from the backdrop of the global pandemic crisis, falling oil prices, border closure and the recent #EndSARS social unrest across the country, which in the aftermath, left several small businesses, shopping malls and outlets, properties, amongst others, vandalized, looted and burnt  beyond recognition.However, during a visit to some markets in Lagos and interactions with sellers of the commodities as at the time of writing this report, we gathered from some sellers as well as buyers that this spike in price is seasonal, but that the rising prices and product’s scarcity have become an issue which requires government and relevant stakeholders’ immediate interventions.At a Lagos market, MallamAdamu, who has been an onion dealer for over seven years noted that the scarcity is due to environmental as well as human factors. In his words: “The scarcity of onions is due to the flooding which has windswept the farmlands in the northern region of nigeria and as a result there is a record of poor harvest. Also, storing these produce requires functional storage facilities, which currently are in poor conditions. While transporting the onions from the north down to other parts of nigeria for distribution, there is always the issue of stop and search on the highway by security operatives, after which, when you are found clean, you will have to settle (bribe) them handsomely. If you do not, it becomes another problem. So, that cost will get added to our product which in turn, raises our selling price just to cover up for the costs incurred while the goods were in transit”Adamu further disclosed that prices differ across different regions and it is dependent on the availability of the onions as a bag now goes for as high as N50,000 from the initial N16,000 as the demand gets higher.Similarly, Monday Itoro, a consumer, said it is surprising that the government is not making efforts to salvage the situation by providing storage facilities for the farmers to make the produce available all year-round for Nigerians.“A bag of rice is like N30,000; Christmas is next month, the price of everything is going up just like that.    The government who said the youths are lazy is not doing anything to help these farmers and also make life easy for Nigerians. Onions that I used to buy at N200 for that small basket from the seller is now almost N5,000 today     . I am surprised at how the prices are just rising and the government is doing nothing,” she lamented."

They produce it here, transport it further to other west African countries and sell it there for about half the price? how does that make sense?Check Dangote Cement results. They have close to 50 gross margins from their Nigerian operations, but less than 30% pan African. Why the disparity?We used to produce about 6m tonnes of rice, and they managed to sell at 13000 per bag before border closure, now we're hearing that with all the intervention, the production is now over 8m tonnes, but price is over 25k, simply because borders are closed, so they see opportunity to exploit, because to them, this is the opportunity to make a killing let them make the most before government changes policy, that's their thinking when it should have been how to improve quality.Thesame mentality that will make an elected official think about how to amass the most, cos na opportunity. let him amass before time runs out. when he should be thinking on how to best represent those that elected him.The points you've raised about cost of production, economies of scale and all are very very true. But there's also a funny greedy/exploitative nature some Nigerians exhibit.Apart from cost of fuel, and transportation, most other input for cement cost little or nothing. it shouldn't cost more than 1500 per bag.There was a time during GEJ when. the government met with Dangote or maybe all cement manufacturers now, and they crashed the price from around 1800 to 1400."

805,,,"nigeria and Bangladesh are both developing countries, each with its challenges. The politics and social fabric in both societies are highly complex with storied and blood-drenched histories. With a population of approximately 200 million and 165 million in nigeria and Bangladesh respectively, both countries feature among the most highly populated nations in the world.The challenges posed by a huge population in terms of jobs creation, skills development and empowerment, as well as robust resource mobilization to fund development resonates across both nations. Similarly, the two countries have a shared history marked by a prolonged period of political instability lasting decades post-independence.Yet, in recent times, Bangladesh has been able to record significant economic progress, making laudable headway around industrialisation, growth, and competitiveness. nigeria on the other hand remains wallowed in sub-par economic growth, with a business cycle and fiscal position that move in line with ever so volatile global crude oil prices.Unemployment is stubbornly high and rising, per capita GDP is retrogressing, manufacturing remains lacklustre, and with critical underinvestment in essential infrastructure, nigeria’s long-term potential remains severely challenged.A quick Google search would reveal the starkly different economic narrative of the two countries: while headlines across major international press read along the lines of “The Rise and Rise of Bangladesh,” the Nigerian picture is the opposite, reflecting the comatose status of the country as the clichéd ‘Giant of Africa’ that is increasingly finding it hard to trudge along as it remains pulled down by the weight of its problems.nigeria’s Fourth Republic: A New Dawn?The emergence of nigeria’s Fourth Republic in 1999 was the beginning of a new era. nigeria had withstood the test of time marked by a rollercoaster of fundamental socio-political and economic problems that had challenged the country’s very existence and was able to segue into a nascent democracy with renewed hopes going into the new millennium.Following this transition, nigeria embarked on a series of reforms that yielded tangible improvements in economic outcomes, and significantly improved the macroeconomic environment in the country. More prudent fiscal management encouraged national savings and improved macroeconomic stability.In setting the fiscal budget, the government jettisoned the market-price of crude-oil approach and adopted the benchmark oil-price approach – where fiscal spending is predicated on a predetermined oil-price and production level for the year – a significant reform which helped put the lid on government expenditure.Oil receipts above the benchmark were to be saved in the Excess Crude Account (ECA), a contingency fund designed to create a buffer during periods of commodity shock to oil revenues. Nigerian authorities also negotiated a historic debt relief with multilateral lenders, leading to the Paris Club agreement which reduced nigeria’s overall debt stock by $18 billion in 2005.The watershed deal provided vital policy space for nigeria, giving the country much-needed fiscal room to fund long-term development. The Fiscal Responsibility Act enacted in 2007 institutionalised key reforms ensuring sustained fiscal discipline.The government also pushed ahead with a number of pro-growth reforms which helped diversify the GDP away from crude-oil and gave rise to other vibrant sectors in the economy. One of the most noteworthy being the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry, which paved the way for productive private investments leading to a remarkable transformation in the industry.The bank consolidation exercise in 2004 equally created a more robust, stronger banking sector, resulting in improved financial intermediation and financial inclusion.While the political stability achieved alongside strong macroeconomic reforms resulted in high growth rates in the Nigerian economy, with GDP growth averaging 7.1% between the periods of 1999-2010, compared to a paltry 1.7% achieved during military rule between 1983 and 1999, nigeria was unable to translate these gains in the macroeconomy into substantial improvement in living standards and development outcomes. Poverty remained stagnant, and growth was not inclusive.Bangladesh: Still a Shaky Political RegimeWhile nigeria’s return to democracy at the turn of the century ushered in a new era of political stability – leaving behind the prior decades’ instability of military rule, the shift in Bangladesh to a stable political regime has been patchy.Following nearly two decades of military rule ending in 1990, a non-elected, non-partisan caretaker government was put in place to manage the transition to democratic rule, and the country subsequently held a general election in 1991, adopting the parliamentary system.However, since the transition away from authoritarian military rule, consolidation of democracy in Bangladesh remained lacklustre, with the country’s political structure being labelled a hybrid regime – combining elements of both democracy and autocratic rule.Although the caretaker government was initially intended as a one-off intervention to manage the transition to democratic rule, the system became institutionalised in the mid-1990s as elections were highly fraught, and marked with violence. The caretaker system remained in place up until 2011 when the country devolved into a political crisis involving military interventions in 2006-2008.In 2015, another political crisis escalated, due to turmoil between the two main political parties, following the controversial 2014 general elections, with the opposing party demanding for a return to the caretaker system. The economic condition in the country over the period of instability remained bleak, and it wasn’t until 2006 that Bangladesh began its economic ascent, which at the time was dismissed as a fluke.Choices Shaping RealityAlthough the structure of the Nigerian economy has evolved over the years, with crude oil currently accounting for under 10% of national output compared to nearly 40% in 2000, diversification away from oil has not trickled down to fiscal revenues and export earnings.This reliance on the oil sector is the Achilles heel of the Nigerian economy, and key economic indicators in the country largely mirror volatilities in the global oil market.As oil still accounts for around 62% of government revenues; over 90% of export earnings, and forms the bedrock of the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves, a crash in global crude oil prices is all it takes for the national currency to go on a freefall, inflation to spiral, capital inflows to dry up, and output in other sectors to contract.A critical challenge for nigeria is to identify sectors in which the country has a strong comparative advantage, and strategically position these sectors for exports. In Bangladesh, this export-led model is the impetus for the country’s high growth rates and encouraging signs of economic take-off.Through its garment industry, Bangladesh has been able to strategically place itself as the world’s second-leading exporter of ready-made garments (RMG), while creating broad-based growth. For nigeria, a key thrust for the government is transforming the agriculture sector to be the leading driver of job creation and export diversification.While nigeria’s abundant labour and arable-land make it very much suited to a green revolution, challenges abound which policy has hitherto failed to address in order to unleash the potential of the sector.Farming practices are largely subsistent, and the agriculture sector in nigeria is dominated by smallholder farms. Poor farm management practices and lack of sufficient fertilizer drag yields on produce. The yield on a staple like cereal is 1,444kg per hectare in nigeria, compared to 3,810kg per hectare and 7,114kg per hectare in South Africa and Egypt respectively.This low productivity in the agriculture sector is made all the more acute by the severe infrastructure gap in the country. While the transport system in Bangladesh remains underdeveloped, the country boasts of a comparatively stronger transport network than nigeria, having a national railway that connects different parts of the country including special parcel trains for transporting agricultural products.The lack of extensive road and rail network that links different parts of the country in nigeria severely limits access to markets for farmers, and poor storage facilities increase postharvest losses. All these challenges have stifled the promise of Nigerian agriculture, ensuring that the contribution of the sector to revenues and exports remains low, and the value-added per capita in the sector has risen by less than 1% annually, over the past 20 years.Yet the challenges impeding on nigeria’s agricultural transformation are symptomatic of the broader economic malaise in the country. The country’s underinvestment in critical infrastructure alongside the weakening economic indicators continue to weigh on the potential of key sectors across the economy.The Bangladeshi Economic NarrativeIn Bangladesh, prudent macroeconomic management has ensured a favourable environment for growth and investments while boosting overall economic resilience. The country’s Public Money and Budget Deficit Management Act (2009) stipulates that public debt as a percentage of GDP should be gradually declining.In line with this legislation, policymakers in Bangladesh have kept the lid on public spending. Although challenged in terms of sufficient revenue mobilisation, the emphasis on spending control has kept the fiscal deficit in the country below the budget target of 5% over the last decade.This has resulted in a steady trend in the public debt profile of the country, with a historical average in public debt to GDP ratio of 35.2% and has equally helped to keep inflation within the Bank of Bangladesh’s (BB) target of 5.5%. On the back of this macroeconomic stability, Bangladesh has been able to attain the ‘7% magic mark’, the level of GDP growth rate needed for an economy to double its size within a generation.As the world marches onto the new decade on the pandemic induced bleak note, Bangladesh’s strong fiscal indicators give it the fiscal room to implement counter-cyclical policies to mitigate the worst of the global downturn. The country is set to be an outperformer globally, with forecasts indicating that it will surpass regional giant India in terms of GDP per capita within the decade.Population: Dividend or Time-bomb?nigeria’s current population is approximately 200 million. With a population growth rate of 2.6%, the country is set to become the third most populous nation in the world by 2050 with 400 million people. While there’s certainly a strength to numbers, demographic dividend can very easily devolve into a demographic time-bomb if society fails to create opportunities for its teeming youth population.As at Q2 2020, nigeria’s youth unemployment rate came out at 35%. This army of increasingly restive unemployed youth is not sustainable – and nigeria has long been boggled with rising security challenges, all of which are escalated by the economic realities of the day. British economist Robert Malthus made a bleak prediction that unconstrained population growth rate would spell doom for societies, as agricultural output, will fail to keep pace.Luckily, many countries across the world have been able to escape the “Malthusian Catastrophe” by investing in technologies that enhanced agricultural productivity and ensured food security, whilst reducing population growth.Although fertility rates tend to decline with rising per capita GDP levels, Bangladesh was able to expedite its fertility transition at a very low per capita GDP level through an aggressive family planning programme that provided door-step delivery of contraceptives to women in the early 1970s. Between 1971 and 2004, Bangladesh was able to halve its fertility rate.By effectively managing population growth, the country was able to record a faster rise in per capita GDP. In strategizing for the future, one of the fundamental questions nigeria needs to ask is the sustainability of the country’s population growth rate.Looking AheadAs nigeria pushes ahead with policies to unlock investments and deliver high economic growth, it is imperative that growth is broad-based and inclusive. The Nigerian economy has long been characterised by periodic bursts of high GDP growth rates – largely following strong global oil prices – with little achievement in terms of poverty eradication and job creation.A continuous repeat of this so-called jobless growth can only be avoided by ensuring that future growth is driven by highly labour-intensive sectors, and targeted social policies aimed at empowering the populace at the grassroots level are successfully implemented at scale.One of the most remarkable aspects of Bangladesh’s economic progress has been the country’s ability to translate economic growth into substantial improvement in social outcomes and livelihoods for those at the bottom of the pyramid. Public investment in technology, rural infrastructure and human capital boosted the country’s agricultural productivity.As a result, Bangladesh made substantial progress toward food security despite its high population density, lack of arable-land, and frequent natural disasters, and agriculture accounted for 90% of the reduction in poverty between 2005 and 2010. Also, the labour-intensive nature of the economy’s key driver of exports – the garment industry –has helped make growth inclusive, with 80% of garment workers being women.This is further re-enforced by the country’s success in implementing grassroots level, pro-poor policies, with gender at the heart of its development strategy.In supporting sectors for growth, it is paramount that the Nigerian government identifies the root cause of underperformance so that policies are targeted at addressing fundamental concerns, as opposed to providing palliatives, or in some cases, aggravating existing problems.nigeria’s ban of foreign exchange access for key products including agricultural produce and the border closure are prime examples. Whilst many countries have resorted to some form of protectionism in a bid to develop local industry, policymakers must not lose sight of the fact that the key impediment to growth for local producers in nigeria is the harsh operating environment and critical infrastructure gaps.nigeria needs to re-assess its priorities as reflected in the country’s fiscal spending. Government spending is largely channelled towards a burgeoning recurrent expenditure. At the same time, the sluggish improvement in fiscal revenues has failed to catch up with the rapidly increasing fiscal spending. This has resulted in a fast build-up of public debt.In Q1 2019, debt servicing accumulated 99% of the Federal Government’s retained revenue. This spending pattern is not sustainable, and the economy is reeling from a lack of sufficient capital expenditure to plug critical gaps in healthcare, education and other key sectors. From 2015-2018, nigeria spent ₦2.3 trillion on petrol subsidies, an amount which if harnessed judiciously could have provided a meaningful contribution to the country’s decayed infrastructure.Reforms such as reducing spending on subsidies and overheads must be pushed ahead. The recently announced removal of subsidies on petrol points in the right direction. However, more important is that the savings are redirected into productive capital spend.By pursuing sound macroeconomic policies and investing heavily in social and physical infrastructure, nigeria can effectively capitalise on its low labour costs like Bangladesh, and status as Africa’s largest economy to position itself as a leading recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) globally.However, the proportion of FDIs to total investment flows dropped from 20% in 2016 to a meagre 4% in 2019. The lack of investor interest in committing patient capital, which confers substantially greater benefits to the economy, is a key area of concern.The underlying challenges associated with poor infrastructure are further aggravated by unfavourable policies such as the multiple exchange rate regime which all act to deter long-term investment inflows.Echoes from Charles Dickens The title for this article borrows from Charles Dickens’ book, A Tale of Two Cities. As an opener, Dickens made the famous expression “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” 2020 is most certainly not the best of times for any country on the planet.However, with a GDP growth forecast of 3.8% for Bangladesh compared to Agusto & Co.’s forecast of a 4.5% contraction for nigeria, what is today the worst of times for Bangladesh could very easily be nigeria’s best of times in this decade – should business continue as usual.Economic transformation is by no means easy to achieve, and important trade-offs have to be made that would inevitably entail some painful structural adjustments. But a change of direction is vital, again inspired by Dickens, to enable nigeria to leap from the winter of despair to the spring of hope.While Bangladesh and nigeria are by no means a homogenous pair, both countries share similar scenarios which make progress challenging to achieve. However, the former has been making significant strides suggestive of a nascent economic transformation building momentum in the country, and the latter can look to it for pointers on how to refocus.SOURCE: https://brandspurng.com/2020/11/19/nigeria-vs-bangladesh-a-tale-of-two-countries/"

813,,,"nigeria closed all its land borders and halted all trade relations with its neighbors (Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger) in August 2019 without a timeline of reversal. The reason touted for this radical move by President Buhari was the need to curtail the smuggling of goods such as rice and textiles to boost domestic production. The government also claimed curbing the illegal supply of weapons into the country as one of the aims of the unilateral border closure. This came at a time when African countries are trying to remove border restrictions in accordance with the goals of African Continental Free Trade Agreement signed by all African countries except Eritrea. That decision, clearly ill-thought-out at the time has proven insufficient to meet its aims.Due to a deficit of infrastructure, the subsequent increase in the domestic production of rice is not on a trajectory fast enough to feed the nation in the next few years. The effects of the border closure alongside other protectionist policies such as the 70% duty imposed on rice imports through the nation’s seaports in 2013 has put nigeria in a very dire situation, particularly with food. In the last 5 years, between September 2015 and September 2020, food inflation rose by 108%.This, alongside the tensions in future trade relations facilitated by the lockdown which has had a staggering effect on Benin Republic’s economy is more than enough reason for such a bad policy to be repealed.This is why the recent news of land borders being opened for exports should be good news. However, the fine details make it the opposite. On November 11, it came to public attention that Dangote Cement, a subsidiary of Dangote Holdings Ltd. and Bua Cement have been allowed to export goods by land. There have been speculations as to whether this is an indication that the borders will soon be opened for the continuation of trade. An assessment of Aliko Dangote, the principal beneficiary of this government largesse suggests that these speculations are pipe dreams.Aliko Dangote, who comfortably sits in the top spot among the wealthiest Africans,is a man whose rise to stupendous affluence is a far cry from a rag to riches story. At the age of 21, he obtained a $3,000 loan from his uncle, Dantata to import and sell agricultural commodities in nigeria. He was successful at this and was able to repay the entire loan within 3 months of starting operations. Since then, over the past three decades, Dangote has grown his business empire into a formidable conglomerate with interests encompassing many industries, including oil and gas, consumer goods, and manufacturing with about 80% of the conglomerate’s revenue coming from Dangote Cement. The Dangote Cement subsidiary produces 44 million metric tons of cement every year and operates in 10 African countries. Dangote also owns the world’s third-largest sugar refinery, and together, all his publicly traded companies make up a quarter of the market capitalization of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. In light of this, it comes as no surprise that he has a net worth of more than $10 billion.Read more: https://thefederation.com.ng/2020/11/15/a-concrete-tomb-for-a-rigid-country-by-joshua-lawal/"

He said, “my colleagues and I who are badly affected by the border closure sit here every day gnashing, some of us are now out of business, but Dangote trucks loaded with cement drive pass the border freely and on their way back to nigeria are again loaded with bags of foreign rice, groundnut oil and other goods. The trucks are not checked by officials of the Nigerian customs at the port of entry. We are suspecting that men of the Nigerian Customs are on the payroll of Dangote Group, which can only explain why they are often not checked.”Meanwhile, other eye witnesses also narrated that at times the truck drivers stop at some Customs check points to offload a few bags of rice as compensation for the officials who eventually grant them passage.Meanwhile, in October 2019 when the Customs Comptroller-general, Hameed Ali spoke to the media in Abuja, he reiterated his agency’s commitment to President Mohammadu Buhari’s land border shut down directive, saying that it will help nigeria to have total control over what comes in and goes out of the country.“All goods, for now, are banned from being exported or imported through our land borders and that is to ensure that we have total control over what comes in,” Hameed said.Reconciling the Customs chief’s statement with current realities has become a bit confusing giving current findings that Dangote Cement trucks has unfettered access to and from nigeria’s land borders with the express support of officials of the Nigerian Customs.Although Buhari’s border closure directive was targeted at encouraging the consumption of locally grown produce such as rice, despite that, the reason why foreign rice keeps flooding the Nigerian market can now be known to the public.“In the wake of this new reality, a question now being asked across several quarters is if the Presidency is in support of Dangote Group’s smuggling activities through nigeria land borders particularly the Seme border? if the answer is yes, then we may have a huge case of nepotism in our hands, but if for any reason, the presidency is not ‘aware’, then Dangote Group needs to be sanctioned immediately, said a concerned Nigerian.Dangote Group is publicly perceived as the highest benefactor of nigeria’s economy, as there are countless allegations of tax waivers which the business conglomerate enjoys from the government from time to time.Responding to our report when we reached out to Dangote Group, its Head of Corporate Communications, Anthony Chiejina said the group was not the only one granted partial license by the Nigerian government to operate while the border was shut, he said other companies like Flour Mills and Bua were also operating under same license, why are concentrating on Dangote alone he queried?When asked if he is also aware that Dangote trucks are used for smuggling large quantity of foreign rice into the country, he said, “well you know majority of these drivers cannot be trusted, sometimes they engage in illegal activities but I can assure you that we know nothing about it”.Mr. Anthony also failed to respond to the question if Customs officials are under the company’s payroll as at the time of filing this report.More details soon.–DESMOND IKE-CHIMA"

We endorse the call by traditional rulers for regular consultations with state governors and federal authorities on challenges facing the state and for appropriate recognition of their role in the Constitution. The security architecture of the country requires adjustment to adequately address the threats and realities of insecurity in the country. There should be more police presence in communities in the South west states. While there are legitimate concerns contained in the initial ENDSARS movement, these have been hijacked by criminals and other elements with ulterior and negative forces and degenerated into anarchy. There is a need to undertake preventive actions aimed at prevention of repeat of what happened in the country following the ENDSARS demonstrators. Security needs to be strengthened in all states. We wish to encourage the nigeria Police by responding to their needs and appeal to them to do more to protect lives and properties and enhance security all over the country. We call for specific measures and proposals to repair damage done to the physical infrastructure and economic assets of the South West. Review of reports of constitutional conferences including the 2014 National Conference and implement some of the recommendations especially with reference to security, economy, equal treatment for citizens all over the country. We believe that the prolonged closure of the border has caused economic difficulties and should be re-examined to alleviate problems of the people in the border communities and prices of some essential commodities. There is a need to review the closure and permit resumption of economic and trading activities.You should also READ  Young Parliamentarians commend Osinbajo's messages to Youths during protests A comprehensive programme that addresses youth employment and empowerment should be prioritized.

883,,,"The Nigerian government has allowed Dangote Cement to resume exports across its land borders, raising hopes that Africa’s most populous nation may be opening up trade with neighbors after a year-long blockade.President Muhammadu Buhari‘s administration gave its authorization for Africa’s biggest producer to export cement to Niger and Togo in the third quarter for the first time in ten months, Michel Puchercos, chief executive officer, said on an investor call in Lagos. The export was made possible “through authorization given by this administration,” he said.The exemption to Dangote Cement is seen as a softening of the government’s position on a border closure that started in August last year, and could open the way for other bushinesses to fully resume exports across the country’s land barriers.Nigerian authorities closed borders with neighboring countries including Benin and Niger to curb smuggling and boost local production. Although the blockade encouraged the consumption of locally grown produce such as rice, it hurt factories across West Africa, which rely on nigeria’s market of 200 million people.Dangote resumed land export with “restricted volumes,” and plans to grow the trade using the sea channels, according to Puchercos.The Lagos-based company’s plan to buy back some of its shares has been delayed by market volatility and low liquidity, which have affected valuation, Guillaume Moyen, acting chief financial officer said at the same conference call.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-11-09/nigeria-exempts-dangote-cement-from-land-border-closureLalasticlalaMynd44"

887,,,"Attention President Muhammadu Buhari -  Sulaiman Tukur I  find it compelling to write and call your attention upon strong conviction that your top functionaries are not briefing you well on the true situation in the country. The fallout of ENDSARS protest and subsequent looting of various warehouses to get access to COVID-19 palliatives hoarded by various state governors, which are meant to cushion the effects of coronavirus lockdown has further exposed to you what is happening in the country.But, we're surprised how your Media aide Malam Garba Shehu issued a statement from Presidency defending the act of the state Governors and condemning the hungry Nigerians.At this point, let me commend your efforts in transforming the nation's economy from mono economy model to diversified economic model. A lot of policies, programmes and interventions has been introduced all aims towards promoting Micro,Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), which are the backbones for economic growth and development. The programmes are numerous to mention here and it is true that no government in the past has fight poverty the way your Government is doing, You also change the facet of governance by having political will in implementing many policies which your predecessors failed to implemented, amongst them were TSA, Fuel subsidy removal etc. These is quite commendable.However, it is disheartening to mention here that under your watch ,whom we have much hope and confidence that things will change to better, but this administration exposes us to more hardship occasioned by fuel subsidy removal, border closure, banning of importation of some goods without making concrete alternative arrangement to cushion the effect of these decisions. I am not saying that the decisions are not good or ill timed,  but of course, their benefits are for long term. Employment becomes prerogative right of children of political class at the expense of children of poor class. There's absolute abuse and disregard to federal character principles, fair selection and placement. The children of the masses remain jobless as some of us graduated for more than fifteen years without securing a job, while jobs awaits children of powerful and rich people as they graduate, instead of political class including National Assembly Members to create jobs for their children through entrepreneurship to become employer of the labour to complement government efforts in addressing the problem of unemployment, since they have control over means of production (i.e. Land, Labour, Capital and entrepreneurship), rather they are unfairly chasing the few opportunities available for the children of the masses who have no control over the means of production for their children. I want to appeal to you to give matching order to Heads of MDAs to ensure that every Nigerian who is able and willing to work will be given equal opportunity for employment in strict compliance with the Federal character principles. This order should be adhered to accordingly.It is painful that all the white-collar jobs are reserved for children of few influential individuals including the National Assembly members not for all eligible Nigerians. I could recall how we (including your humble self) condemned 2013 Immigration recruitment exercise that cost many lives and others sustained various degrees of injuries.Furthermore, security situation in nigeria from 2015 to date only changes dimension, from Boko Haram to armed banditry and kidnapping. It is disturbing that kidnappers could not be tracked and traced using same mobile phones they used to collect ransom, while stolen phones are tracked and traced easily. I want to inform you that in Zamfara State where I came from ,many people are sleeping in the bush hiding for fear of being attack, people are being killed and kidnapped on daily basis, women are being raped and molested on daily basis, many villages were deserted and the inhabitants are taking shelter from neighboring village with relative peace. These people cannot go to their farms and can't claim their animals and other belonging, bandits, kidnappers and cattle rustlers are moving freely in our villages, and the situation is same in Katsina your  home state.Your dreams for leaving a prosperous nigeria and food sufficient nation cannot be achieved without security.Security personnel engages themselves in all sort of crimes, including taking all sorts of illicit drugs, Nicotine and others. Instead of enforcing laws and preventing crimes, they engage themselves in committing crimes by aiding and abetting wrongdoings, people have no confidence in them anymore. Believe me sincerely if our security personnel especially police are to be subjected to drugs test, many of them will be found positive.How do you expect to have crimes free society while we are recruiting criminals as law enforcement personnel? Some of them see their identity cards and uniforms as an opportunity to engage in unlawful act.Most of them that were deployed to highways to provide security for motorist, instead of providing the security they are busy extorting, abusing, brutalizing and sometimes killing drivers for refusing to give them tips (money) there was several cases to mention. You will see them begging openly like beggars. Even if we are  to have ten million Policemen in nigeria, we won't achieve crime free nigeria , if we continue to recruit criminals and people with questionable character into the service. Government have to flush out bag eggs in our Security Agencies first, if we want succeed in tackling insecurity in the country. I heard you on many occasions prior to your assumption of office saying that how will nigeria overcome its internal security problems while government is recruiting security personnel from motor parks, no enough training and welfare packages. Also a policeman who is an indigene of Benue will be posted to Ibadan Oyo State without given accommodation, he has to in addition to paying rent, feed his family, pay school fees, hospital and other utility bills, and when posted to fight crimes if he eventually died his family will not be given his entitlements in time or not given at all,  and in a situation where his family are residing in police quarters they will be evicted without any consideration. How do you expect the living one in the service to give out their best, while they have seen what happened to those who die in service? I once heard you saying what is Boko Haram? But five years now ,they're still operating in the Northeast.The question here is that what have you done differently to change the situation more than five years now?You have to immediately address these challenges which you been mentioning and direct the securities to go after criminals and stop harassing innocent people and motorist who are on legal business on the roads.The Service chiefs are out of ideas, they are just adding weight while people are being killed on daily basis and you are advised on several occasions to let them go and re-strategise, but you continues to retains them for reason best known to you. Whatever is your reasons you should know that you can't continue doing same thing and achieve different result.  Mr. President ,I am advising you to try to adopt the hire and fire approach and see how things will change quickly. The security architecture of the country needs to be overhauled.Sir, you have not declare state of emergency on the major sector of the economy (i.e. Security, Power, Education, Health etc.) more than five years of your reign. We are still paying for darkness, no security, no good roads, no quality education, no efficient health services delivery, Unemployment remains unchecked over the years, insecurity and uncertainty, high level of poverty and hunger are on the rise, people are force to pay exorbitant and indiscriminate estimated power bills by the Discos because nobody is checkmating them. The cost of education and health services are rising.  In fact, nothing serious has change except hopes!A deliberate initiatives in addition to the existing ones must be put in place by the federal government to reduce the suffering of the masses, this administration has to come up with policies and programmes aimed at cushioning the adverse impact of some of the policies in the short and long runs. This should be done through: -(1) Re-introduction of Federal Mass Transit program to reduce the burden of transport fares to the masses which contributed to the hike of price of everything.(2) Provision of drugs and other hospital consumables at subsidized rates at the various public hospitals.(3) Free medical care for women and children in Federal Government owned hospitals.(4) Free Education up to Secondary level.(5) In addition to school feeding program government should also provide textbooks and other reading, teaching and learning materials to schools. (6) Government must ensure that Discos provide their customers with prepaid meters or they stop charging us based on estimated bills.(7) The federal government has to ensure that it supervise and monitor any interventions given to states for implementation/distribution to eligible people.( You must ensure that people are sleeping with their two eyes closed and traveling by roads without fear of being attack. It will be a great failure on your Government to leave power without tackling the security challenges of the country.(9) You must connect yourself with the masses to know the true situation they're facing, stop believing all what your aids are telling you, do meet traditional leaders, religious leaders and civil society organisations (CSO).(10) last but not least, the federal government should ensure that the Executive Order that gives Local Governments, State Assemblies and the judiciary autonomy come into force immediately to promote Good Governance.As Nigerians we endure many discomforts due to the changes in government policies as such, we need a better life ahead. Your Excellency, you must take immediate steps to contain the growing level of insecurity, unemployment and poverty in the country as the nation is sitting on a time bomb.Sulaiman Tukur.+2348069662894sulaimantukur45@gmail.com"

Northern Governors must work to change the situation.The north has been blessed with human and natural resources more than any other part of the country. We were blessed with population, mass fertile land and abundant mineral resources. In spite of all these, the region is still lagging behind. Our population has only benefited us ,when it comes to elections as it is game of number. From the Northeast to Northcentral down to Northwest, all of the nineteen states that made up the Northern nigeria have some particular crops comprising roots and tubers they can cultivate in commercial quantity. So is also Minerals resources.It took Mr. President four good years preaching and begging us to go back to farm, until last year August he ordered for the closure of the land boarders.It will interest you to know since 2015 to date that God keeps blessing us with enough rainfall year in, year out.When the country's borders were closed for food importation, so as to be able to feed ourselves what did the Northern Governors do to support agriculture to create employment for our youth, create wealth, generate revenue and contribute to the economic growth of the nation. How much did you invest in agriculture to support farmers and the economy of the nation.No economy of any nation can develop without the development and contribution of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), the Federal government provides opportunities by introducing programmes/policies and made funding available for those who are willing to venture, all aims at reducing overdependence on government and contributing to the Economic growth and development of the nation (i.e CBN farmers anchor borrowers, Small and Medium Enterprises Equity Investment Scheme (SMEEIS), Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of nigeria (SMEDAN), Agribusiness Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS), National Poverty Eradication Programmes (NAPEP) ,National Directorate of Employment (NDE), N-Power, Conditional Cash Transfer for vulnerable people and more recent intervention i.e. Covid-19 and Nirsal loans e.tc.We have expected you to support these policies and programmes by doing the needful to ensure the success of the programmes for the benefit of the region and the nation at large.If our Governors have  been  complementing the efforts of Federal Government by shifting concentration and investing heavily in Agriculture and Solid minerals, nigeria would have been hunger and crime free nation. While hunger and unemployment are the major causes of crimes in the society on the other hand, Agriculture ensures food security alone and it also share job creation role with solid minerals development.Mention has to be made here that, had if been the Southern part of the country have the mass and fertile land the Northern part have,  they will feed the west African countries with what they will produce annually, especially the Southwestern States.It is disheartening that people in the North, especially rural populace sit under the shade of the trees doing nothing during dry season while we have so many dams unutilized in the region due to lack of support from government. Our people do travel to southern part during dry season in search for a greener pastures while we have the greener pastures with us here.While our people struggle to take whatever we produce (food and animals) including perishables ones to the south for their consumption, defying security and economic risks on the roads, paying multiple taxations to the southern states, boosting their economy at the expense of ours (i.e paying for hotels accommodation, providing minimal jobs to their youth etc), the southern people never bring down what they have to the north by themselves. We have to go there to buy cars, electronics and electrical appliances, hospital consumables, Palm oil, coconuts, kolanuts, Garri etc and bring them down to the North. Even in transportation business it is hardly for you to see a person from the south conveying people from south to north and vice versa except those with luxurious buses.I am of the opinion that the relationship should be symbiotic, let them bring what they have to us, as we takes what we have to them to achieve balance growth. This will also strengthen the unity and integration of the country as must of them who never travel to north have negative perception about the north.Many will believe with me that some of the security challenges we are facing in many our states were the making of the state governors, by abandoning their responsibilities and failing to invest in Agriculture, Education, Skill Acquisition and their inability to manage and contain the growing farmers/herdsmen and ethnics disputes, being you the chief security officers of your respective states. The region is educationally disadvantage, our illiteracy level is high compared to the southern part.With the available resources at your disposal if judiciously utilize it will go a long way in solving so many problems of your respective states and the region.The Federal Government have never withhold any allocation due to states, you don't have any excuse, you were given all the opportunities and everything, the position you occupies is the second highest elective leadership position in nigeria next to the President, any other elective political post is a representation except Chairman of the Local Government and it is under the purview of the state governments.Our region has endures so much discomforts for long especially now that the economy bites hard, occasioned by fuel subsidy removal, border closure and covid-19 pandemic which translates to hike in prices of everything. Our people complain more than our southern counterparts ,because of lack of availability of jobs and economic activities in the region, if people have something doing and getting money out of it, they hardly complaint about the increase of the cost of living.The Northern Governors forum must take immediate steps to address the growing poverty, hunger, unemployment and insecurity in the region.To this end, I hereby recommend to you as follows:I. Come up with comprehensive development plan for the region in which the 19 states of the region through their Zonal forum i.e east, central and west will come up with their development plan to be incorporated in the overall plan of the region.2. Make the region more economically viable through agriculture and mining.3. Ensure all year round farming in the region by encouraging dry season farming through maintaining of our Dams, provision of power generator sets, inputs and watering equipments and other necessary items for dry season farming.4. Invest heavily in Agriculture by providing seeds, fertilizer, insecticides, herbicides at subside rates to the farmers.5. Ensure that only those in Agricultural Business through their various associationbenefits from Governments' Agricultural intervention not through politicians.6. Reintroduce the services of Agricultural extension workers and marketing board.7. Partner with southern part on the development of Education and the Agriculture.8. Each state should establish Education Trust Fund where contributions for politicians and philanthropists will be received to support the development of the Education in the region.9. Partner with traditional institutions and rural people in area of security.10. Establish Security Trust Fund to support Security Agencies in discharging their duties in the region.Let our region take the lead on the economic development through agriculture and Solid Minerals development.SULAIMAN TUKUR+2348069662894sulaimantukur45@gmail.comGusau, Zamfara State."

919,,,"0. Lol, my brother.. Looks like you have fallen in love with this numbering style..  1. Baseless allegation, as usual. Unless you can provide evidence. The only proven rice cabal are the rice importers and their collaborators who used various ungodly mechanisms to keep nigeria perpetually dependent on foreign rice, killing the chances of our local rice to strive and improve. 2. Rice farming is not as lucrative as it is now. If you farm rice, like you claimed, you probably are a millionaire now.3. The 9 million tonnes was for last year. This year's production was frustrated by the Coronavirus epidemic, reason for the exploration of the Ecowas program. The US Department of Agriculture, World Markets and Trade also testified to the improvement. Farmers have also testified and the international community has also testified for the remarkable improvement. However, this year has not been really great for the rice industry due to several factors like the Covid-19 and natural hazards, like the flood that wiped out 2 million tons of rice in Northern nigeria. It was really a bad year.. But thank God for the Ecowas Regional Food Security Reserve (RFSR) Programme.4. Demand is currently higher than supply, which is also a sign of business opportunity. You make more money when business is less saturated and have the opportunity of becoming a key player in the industry. If not for the disaster that befell the world, and nigeria, rice would have become cheaper by now.5. This has been replied to.. 6. Another rehashed allegations which have been replied to. There's no point repeating something that has been replied to. It makes the conversation extremely boring and unnecessarily lengthy. If you don't accept the reply given to you for whatever reason, you move on to the next. 7. Wrong. VAT was increased to boost revenue, deal with the minimum wage increase, develop infrastructure, etc.. In case you don't know, taxes are one of the major outlets of a government to make money. The OECD average ratio is 34% while the African ratio is 17%.. However, nigeria is still struggling with a meager 6%..8. Again, you have no evidence nigeria cannot pay back. Just another wild speculation. Meanwhile, the US still owes China an unpaid debt of $1 trillion. No society can survive without debts. It's important. nigeria's debt is even a child's play compared to the world average debt.9. I cannot force you to accept the truth. Whether you accept or not doesn't change anything."

Since our economy will grow with local rice consumption, it's over a year now since the border closure. Can you show us the metric that shows our economy has grown since then? The only thing that has grown is the price of the commodity. Every other thing is back to back failure since then. border closure was supposed to stop fuel smuggling. Result: fuel price hike.border closure was supposed to encourage local rice production. Result: Rise in price of rice border closure was supposed to help customs increase revenue. Result: Increase in VAT and more borrowingsWhere is the anchor borrowers scheme that started five years ago? When is it going to start yielding results? Is it when Jesus comes?

923,,,"My brother, you should say the above when Buhari leaves office. Then we'll discuss. We already saw how Jonathan reduced it to 2bn. The agricultural reform is already yielding results. As for the price of rice, this was due to the closure of border, thereby boosting our our own product, which is an excellently idea. Currently, more and more people are venturing into the lucrative rice farming, which will soon lead to positive results, as supply becomes surplus. Once supply becomes higher than demand, nigeria will begin exporting rice, rather than importing. This is a great development, unless you don't want our economy to grow. What we need now is large scale production. Once these farmers make more money, they'll purchase machines that will foster large scale production.Government is also helping them with grants and low-interest loans, which has been helpful. But Rome was not built a day. Regarding infrastructure, even the worst critic of Buhari knows he's doing absolutely well.God bless you.  "

933,,," https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeYOtFwtYpIAbuja- Lawmakers were on Tuesday in a war of words over the sustainability of the 2021 budget.For describing the budget as “too simplistic, insensitive, unrealistic and does not reflect an understanding of national problems,” Senator Eyinnaya Abaribe was criticized by some of his colleagues.Speaking on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday, during debate of the 2021 budget presented by President Muhammadu Buhari, Senator Abaribe representing Abia South Senatorial District, said the budget indicates government disconnect with global realities.Describing the 2021 fiscal policy as “same old news with nothing new,” Abaribe also queried social interventions programmes initiated by the federal government to enhance job creation.According to him, “In a country with over 30 million unemployed, employing 1,000 people per local government cannot generate the kind of jobs that the country needs.”“Definitely, this can’t be the flagship idea of a government that understands the magnitude of the problems.”Hé explained that “resolving issues such as the border closure, dealing with the continued harassment of young people who are trying to participate in the new global economy, and improving the productivity in agriculture are much more likely to have a sustained impact and create much more jobs than tokenistic projects by a financially distressed government.The Minority Leader of the Senate underscored government debt profile, emphasizing on finding alternativeHe added that the country’s “oil era is fading out, but the government retains an attitude of business-as-usual.“This is not a time for tokenistic ideas. nigeria needs big ideas. This 2021 budget proposal failed to deliver on that point.”“The 2021 budget presents no overreaching economic philosophy.”“While nigeria postures as a capitalistic economy, Buhari’s 2021 federal budget deemphasises the role of the markets in addressing the challenges in the economy, and seeks to expand the size of government.”On taxation, he condemned the recent tax increase from 5% to 7.5%, highlighting that the increase has further added to the suffering of Nigerians.The 2021 budget proposes the building of new healthcare centres, procurement and equipping of numerous primary healthcare centres, a move that Senator Abaribe argued does not allow for private sector involvement in the health sector.Abaribe was interrupted by the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, who criticized his stance, insisting that “this is a budget estimate. If I was you I’ll do the same thing you are doing.”In his contribution, Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, described Abaribe as “playing politics with the 2021 budget.”He applauded the spread of capital projects in the 2021 fiscal policy, describing it as the right move to reposition the economy.Describing the budget as been in line with the challenges of the time, Senator Kalu also praised the creation of special interventions for the 774 local governments across nigeria.For Senator Gabriel Suswam, “the items in the 2021 budget are not sustainable over a long period of time.”Stressing the need to reduce borrowing, he warned that “borrowing may become a vicious circle that may lead into the 2022 budget.”Senator Oker-Jev Emmanuel, Benue North/West, stressed that there was nothing on ground to show that the country can finance the 2021 budget.He called the attention of stakeholders to what he described as “Fertilizer priced out of the reach of Farmers.”Source: https://www.independent.ng/lawan-abaribe-others-in-war-of-words-over-2021-budget/"

949,,,"Still on COVID-19 and Ayade’s interventions By Chidi Onyemaizu It is no longer news that the COVID-19 curve is flattening nationwide. Even states that were the epicentres of the deadly virus are now having the desired breather.This is heart warming but before we start to cling wine glasses, the world must not forget, and Nigerians must remember Governor Ben Ayade‘s mix in the whole gamut of COVID-19 trajectory in nigeria. We must call to mind, the Ayade model, the COVID-19 Ayade model because it worked, because it is salutary.The Cross River state governor who is a professor of Environmental Macrobiology was a seer and traiblazer as far as the virus was concerned. His unprecedented proactive measures which were initially jerred at, sneered at and ridiculed would turn out to be the antitode that kept the virus away from his state for a longtime.And wait for this, the world would later copy him and the ""home prophet"" would later be applauded and cheered by his own people!Essentially before COVID-19 eventually berthed in Cross River, the state was  for a longtime the last state standing. And many were baffled.Of the 36 states of the federation and Abuja, Cross River was for many months untainted by the pandemic even when neighbouring states were being ravaged by the scourge. This was a no mean feat achieved by Cross River people and their governor, largely through proactive measures and strict adherence to preventive protocols put in place by the government.The granite truth is that though Cross River now has COVID-19 cases, one can not deny that the state and it's governor fought gallantly to keep the virus at bay. This must be acknowledged by everyone.COVID-19 crept into nigeria in February and became a pandemic in March. For four months, Cross River fought valiantly, for four months, Cross River held out, even when neighbouring states were marooned in the virus.How Cross River managed to remain free from the virus often sent queer, creepy sensation down the spine of critics but looking back,  it is now clear it was no rocket science.It was simply made possible by a thinking head. It is no secret that Professor Ayade trailblazed virtually all preventive protocols that were later adopted by the world as fighting tools against the pandemic.For example, to curtail the spread of the virus into Cross River, Ayade was the first governor to seal all entry and exits points into his state and despatched personnel equipped with over 100 vehicles to monitor the border closure as well as compliance throughout the state.As the governor would say, Cross River did not Lockdown but locked out the virus.Even before the border closure, people coming into the state were thoroughly subjected to temperature checks.Commercial vehicles and even Keke NAPEPE plying intra- state routes were subjected to a new seating arrangement in line with the COVID-19 preventive protocols introduced by the state.Cross River was also the first to adopt the no masks no movement policy before other states, including even the Federal GovernmentAnd long before masks made from fabrics became a global fade, as opposed to the synthetic imported surgical masks, Ayade was the first to introduce its use, ordering the Cross River Garment Factory to mas produce it and distribute free of charge to Cross Riverians.It is noteworthy that this was at a time when the World Health Organisation (WHO) said the use of masks made from fabric was useless in stopping the spread of the virus.The world health body was to chew on its words after further studies proved their initial position wrong and recommended its use throughout the world.Today, not only that Cross River produces millions of nose masks which are distributed to the citizens free, it also now manufactures Personal Protective Equipment, PPEs and face shields which are distributed  free to medical personnel.Essentially, Cross River remains a model on how to confront a deadly virus as COVID-19. That it took the state long to record  cases of the virus should not surprise anybody because the state and its governor fought a good fight.And now with an ultra modern drive-in testing centre established by the Ayade administration to make testing for the virus quick and more accessible to the people, it is crystally clear that the Cross River is well prepared for the aggressive management of the pandemic.The result is the manifest daily declining cases in the state.The Ayade COVID-19 model worked for Cross River, it worked for nigeria and it worked for the world!Chidi Onyemaizu is Senior Special Assistant on Print Media to Governor Ayade"

953,,,"In a bid to boost rice production in nigeria and pave the way for self-reliance, the President shut the country’s land borders and rice farmers went into overdrive nationwide. It was time to take nigeria back from foreign nations that have turned the country to a dumping ground for foodstuffs.Besides the protection of locally manufactured goods, the move was also against smuggling of oil products out of nigeria, and the inflow of small arms and drugs into the country.To achieve this objective, the Federal Government through the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu appointed a seasoned officer from the high-pressure world of law enforcement, Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) Udu Moses Ogechi, to lead a coalition force of border guards drawn from various security agencies to keep smugglers at bay.The Presidential Task Force christened Enhanced nigeria-Benin Joint border Patrol has its operational headquarters at the ever-busy Seme border, in Badagry area of Lagos. It has done much in reshaping the future of the nation.Four days before nigeria closed the border without warning, security agents had intercepted truckloads of prohibited tramadol and codeine, and Customs officers had earlier impounded loads of Pump Action Rifles smuggled into the country.Today, with the Presidential Task Force at work, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for anyone to smuggle banned items across the Nigerian border.In fact, one of the accomplishments that the President proudly celebrated in his Democracy Day address, on June 12, was the efficiency of police officers and other security agents involved in the special operation to keep nigeria’s borders safe.“To reduce security challenges through our external borders especially smuggling of oil products out of the country, inflow of small arms and drugs into the country and equally protect our local manufacturers, we introduced operation ‘Ex-Swift Response’ closing our borders from August 20th 2019, and have considerably succeeded in meeting its objectives as well as improving our national revenue,” the President said in his broadcast.British automatic pistol recovered from bandits at Seme by the Ogechi-led nigeria-Benin border Patrol team.More in HOMESee How BBNaija Finalist, Nengi Described Other BBNaija Housemates Nigerian Govt Approves Reopening of Universities, Polytechnics, Others Panic As Man Is Seen Struggling To Come Out After Davido Pushed Him Inside Pool During Video Shoot Breaking News: Appeal Court Reverses Diri's Sack As Bayelsa Governor 'Bastard Son of A Thousand Fathers' – Nigerians Curse Man For Informing MTN About Latest ‘Cheat Code’ For Free DataAlthough, it has not gone down well with neighboring countries, the border closure has been described by Nigerian officials as one visionary and pro-active move against the spread of the novel coronavirus which the World Health Organization (WHO) first reported on December 31, 2019.Day and night, Ogechi’s men are seen maneuvering their patrol vehicles through neighborhoods along the border, risking life and limb to protect and serve the nation.Before he was singled out for the task of carrying out the presidential mandate of securing nigeria’s most strategic land border, Ogechi had served as the Squadron Commander, MOPOL 43, Lion Building; Commander in charge of Diplomatic Missions and the Commander, Lion Building.Ogechi who hailed from Akaeze, at Ivo LGA, in Ebonyi State, had served as the Commander, Federal Task Force on Narcotic and Counterfeit Drugs under the late Dr Dora Akunyili, and had contributed largely to the successes recorded in the war against fake drugs. He led the operations.During his years at NAFDAC, he led the sanitization of Onitsha Head Bridge drug market, where illicit drugs worth billions of naira were confiscated, along with arms and ammunition.The ongoing border patrol mission has witnessed seizures of contraband goods worth billions of Naira and the seizure of weapons and illicit drugs.According to the Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele who visited the Seme border recently, Ogechi’s activities have earned nigeria huge revenue.SOURCE:https://www.meenatnigeria.com/police-spearhead-fgs-new-drive-for-independence/"

957,,,"nigeria’s Diamond Jubilee: Leveraging the brand to greater lofty heights with hope, unity and progressBy Akinsola Delenigeria’s Diamond Jubilee has, auspiciously, coincided and by Divine arrangement with the year that the first two digits match the second two digits; a special and unique year – 2020. The next year that will follow this magical pattern is 2121 which will take another 100 years for it to evolve.nigeria, endowed with world-class human capital, natural resources, tropical forests, scenic savannah, varieties of landscapes, perfect climate, not freeze cold or oven hot, beaches, mangrove forest in the delta is once again the cynosure of the continent and the world for attaining the milestone.Abuja, the nation’s pride and capital, boasts of intriguing landmarks of world-class and a few of our cities and capitals such as Lagos, Calabar, Port Harcourt, Uyo, Jos, Kano, Asaba, Kastina, Owerri, Enugu among others which have quite a number of cultural offerings and landscapes of scenic splendor for travellers, tourists, visitors and businessmen and women.As a result of the uniqueness and peculiarity of the triple score, the government and people of nigeria should burst with excitement and commemorate the occasion of a life time as the majority of the current generation may not be around to celebrate the nationhood in 2121. The 60th anniversary presents a double-barrel or multi-barrel celebration; first, for a united nation in spite of vicissitudes, challenges, civil war and other potent threats including centrifugal forces. Some nations, naysayers, doomsday prophets, cynics and captious critics had predicted the disintegration and balkanization of the Nigerian state before now but our diversities have become our strength. The lyrics of the National Anthem are instructive and apposite about the indissolubility of the country -- `` Arise, O compatriots, nigeria's call obey. To serve our fatherland, With love and strength and faith. The labour of our heroes past, shall never be in vain. To serve with heart and might, One nation bound in freedom, peace, and unity’’.Second, as a nation for surviving economic recessions and mobilizing effectively toward flattening the COVID-19 curve in the anniversary year with minimal casualties.Leading nigeria with its chequered history at this time on a year-long activities commemorating this millennium event is the man on whom history and destiny beckons who was part of the military intervention(s) in the politics of the country and now a champion and defender of democratic nigeria. Muhammadu Buhari is the man whom the cap fits, the sixth democratically elected President of nigeria and the chief celebrator. In  our national trajectory of triumphs, achievements, failings and tragedies, definitely we have cause to celebrate. Just as President Buhari joined world leaders in congratulating the United Nations at 75 for remaining committed to founders' aspirations of fostering global peace and security among others, nigeria has not done badly in following the path of national growth and development and therefore, the ``labour of our heroes and founding fathers past has not been in vain.’’On October 1, 2015 in Abuja in his first independence day address to commemorate the nation’s 56th  anniversary after his inauguration on May 29, 2015, Buhari assured Nigerians that he would engender a systemic change in all facets of life but threw a gauntlet: ``We must change our lawless habits, our attitude to public office and public trust. We must change our unruly behavior in schools, hospitals, market places, motor parks, on the roads, in homes and offices.’’ His clarion call was to rally the citizenry to make the necessary sacrifices, allow peace to reign and join the forces to salvage and transform our nation.President Buhari has since at the outset unleashed on the nation his far-reaching policies and programmes to accomplish the task of rebuilding the country through concerted effort, soliciting peace, unity and national cohesion for national progress. Truly, he has touched every facet of national life, building modern rail system, roads and other infrastructure and fighting head-on and headlong the national scourge – corruption and graft as well as insecurity.The 60th anniversary celebration is a remarkable milestone in the annals of our nation as it affords us as a people the opportunity to review our progress and challenges as well as chart the course for our future. A celebration in the service of our fatherland: from vision to actualization and reality, from commitment to continual nation building, from progress to progress.Having walked the tight-rope of political instability and military interregna with national values corrupted and eroded, citizens denied political freedoms, individual protection amid ethnic discrimination, nigeria re-launched itself into democracy and is fast regaining its position as a role model in Africa, restoring democracy in countries that had suffered military junta’s adventurism. Africa’s most populous nation of more than 200 people has evolved as a brand on the continent and internationally, thus becoming a regional power bloc and a respected voice in the comity of nations. Of a truth, 60 years is nothing compared to advanced democracies and nations with 100 or 200 years of nationhood but nonetheless it is significant to continue to leapfrog on the frontiers of nation building and development. Virtually in every sector of national life, nigeria has recorded some giant strides particularly in the Buhari administration worthy of celebration. But the government, in its wisdom, has opted for a low-key celebration. According to Information and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed in a  programme of events lined up by the Federal Government for the anniversary, it will devoid of pomp, glitz, buzz and extravagance. At a joint news conference by the Ministers of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami and the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs who are members of the Branding Committee of nigeria at 60, Muhammed blamed the low-key celebration on the COVID-19 pandemic which, he noted, had imposed some safety protocols on nations across the world.He, however, indicated that nigeria’s Diamond Jubilee will be celebrated throughout a whole year from September 25, 2020 to  September 30, 2021 with different staggered events during the period apart from the activities announced for September 25 to October 1, 2020.The roll call: First Nigerian female commercial pilot and first woman to fly an aircraft in nigeria, Chinyere Kalu, first ever female helicopter combat pilot, Tolulope Arotile, Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, Femi Otedola, billionaire businesswoman, Folorunso Alakija, Tony Elumelu, among others.Just as Julius Nyerere, an innovative thinker and revolutionary African leader, was raised to transform the entire political economy of Tanzania shortly after it got its independence precisely in December 1961 and took some unpopular decisions, all in national interest, so is Buhari, who symbolizes a commitment, a determination and hope, not only to Nigerians, Africa and Africans but to the people of African descent across the world; daring to move in the direction other past Nigerian leaders feared or dreaded.Before entering the political stage on December 31, 1983, the second republic politicians had ruined the nation’s economy, almost prostrated by looting, massive corruption and poor governance and leadership, Buhari was brought in by his colleagues for his no-nonsense anti-corruption stance, discipline and capacity to rebuild the country but the mission was truncated in July 1985 by another set of soldiers and politicians who felt threatened by the policies of his administration particularly the War against Indiscipline.Again in 2015 about 30 years after, by Providence, Buhari was brought in to rebuild nigeria from decades of rot, endemic graft almost a state policy, infrastructure decadence and morass of underdevelopment. With massive launch of infrastructure development particularly the rail system, expressways and anti-corruption war, Buhari has established for himself a reputation as a leader and rebirther of a new nigeria. President Buhari’s life has been of accomplishment in spectacular and extraordinary circumstances. His transformation from a soldier-dictator to a democrat is amazing as his credentials keep soaring and improving by the day piloting a stable democracy as nigeria clocks 60. nigeria and its strong leadership are important to Africa because it is now an exemplar in shift of narrative of the country and the continent as the `arc of instability’. The last line of the second stanza of nigeria’s Anthem harps on the need for national peace and concord as prerequisite to build the nation and to attain ``great lofty heights’’ as a people. In the absence of it, all the national aspirations, hopes, objectives and goals will be dashed.Viewed in its socio-cultural, security and political context, nigeria, under Buhari, has recorded numerous spectacular and impressive feats which have eluded it since independence in 1960. In his second term, Buhari had taken some actions, mostly bold and highlyvisionary, that have now put nigeria on an irreversible road tosustainable development unknown in the history of the country in so short a time. Some of the bold actions are border drill (border closure), power supply, job creation, infrastructure development, increased revenue generation, fight against corruption, increased security and food sufficiency.On power, in a bid to tackle inadequate power supply, hallmarked by Blackouts that is stifling economic development, the Buhari administration entered into an agreement with a German company –Siemens -- in July 2019 to boost power supply. Under thethree-phase agreement, Nigerians will enjoy 7,000 megawatts of reliable power supply by the end of 2021 (phase 1), 11,000 megawattsby the end of 2023 (phase 2) and 25,000 megawatts in the third phase.To put things in perspective, nigeria's current power generation capacity is more than 13,000 megawatts, but only an average of 3,400megawatts get to the consumers. In essence, the current amount of power that reaches consumers will more than double by the end of nextyear with multiplier effect job creation thereby leapfrogging nigeria to the next level of industrial and social development.Buhari expressly stated: “Our goal is simply to deliver electricity to Nigerian businesses and homes. My challenge to Siemens, our partner investors in the distribution companies, the Transmission Company of nigeria and the electricity regulator, is to work hard to achieve 7,000 megawatts of reliable power supply by 2021 and 11,000 megawatts by 2023 – in phases 1 and 2 respectively. After these transmission and distribution system bottlenecks have been fixed, we will seek – in the third and final phase – to drive generation capacity and overall grid capacity to 25,000 megawatts.”Another 'Next Level' achievement of the administration is the new visa policy launched in February 2020 which aims at advancing the goal of building a globally competitive economy by helping attractinnovation and specialized skills and knowledge from abroad tocomplement local ones as well as improve nigeria's business environment, attract foreign direct Investment, boost tourism, and improve African integration without compromising national security and our territorial integrity.The government’s infrastructure development focuses on building and revamping critical ones with more than 50 projects going on across 26 states, including major projects like the Second Niger Bridge, Abuja-Kano Expressway, the Owerri Interchange, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and Port Harcourt-Enugu Expressway unparalleled since nigeria returned to democracy in 1999. The Lagos-Ibadan Standard gauge rail line, a break from the relics of the colonial administration, had been test-run towards inauguration. Another novelty is the job creation initiative popularly called the N-Power Programme aimed at empowering Nigerian youths as well as the Special Public Works programme with the massive engagement of 774,000 Nigerians both old and young for a period of three months with payment of N20,000 monthly allowance to each beneficiary.Anti-graft war has continued to receive multiple fillip from the government, its cardinal programme, as the Independent CorruptPractices and Other Offences Commission (ICPC) has recovered assetsworth N81.23 billion with the breakdown as follows:-  N 41.98bn    --         Money restrained on review of MDAs’Personnel Cost Expenditure and Capital Development Fund-      N35.011bn --          Lands, Buildings & Vehicles-.    N1.167bn      --        Cash in TSA-     N0.77bn        --        Recoveries from Constituency projects tracked-    N 1.097bn     --        Completed constituency projects on returnof contractors to site-    N 0.865bn     --        Cash (other accounts)-    $1.113m       --        Cash (other domiciliary account) converted @ N305/ $For the first time in the annals of governance in the country, Executive Orders were signed by President Muhammadu Buhari. Strikingly and laudably, On May 22, 2020, Executive Order No. 10 of 2020 was initialed for the implementation of financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary with a view to strengthening the institutions at the state level, assert their independence and become accountable in linewith the tenets of democracy as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution. The bold step initiative also gave fillip to the separation of powers, a fundamental principle of government, and strengthens the system of checks and balances.On COVID-19, the administration’s proactive handling of the pandemic with the President providing the right leadership had helped to contain the spread of the virus. A month before the first case of Covid-19 was recorded in the country, the Federal Government announced that it wasstrengthening surveillance at the nation's gateway internationalairports and by Jan. 31, 2020, it set up a Coronavirus Preparedness Group with a view to mitigating the impact of the virus if it eventually spreads to the country. By March 9, about a week after the country's index case, President Buhari established the Presidential Task Force for Covid-19 which immediately swung into action, banning travellers from 15 countries, with over 1,000 cases of the virus from entering nigeria and closing all international airports. It released N10 billion to the Lagos State Government and N5 billion special intervention fund to the NCDC to equip, expand and provide personnel at its facilities and laboratories across the country.Apart from several other interventions, the unprecedented approval by the Buhari administration to inject $1.2 billion in-kind loan into the agriculture sector through the government-to-government bilateral loan from Brazil with support from Deutsche Bank and the Islamic Corporation for Insurance of Export Credit of the Islamic Development Bank is part of efforts to revolutionize the sector. On the new budget cycle, it stands to the credit of the Buhari-led Executive in collaboration with the National Assembly to return the country to the 12-month (January to December) budget cycle for the first time since 1999 against the March to April or June cycle. It is, however, unquantifiable the damage that delayed passage of budgets had done to the economy over the years. In 2019, the Nigerian economy grew at an average rate of 2.2% over the first three quarters, compared to 1.7% over the same period in 2018. Notably in foreign trade performance, strong performance in the external sector suggests increasing diversification of exports and export revenue with the value of imports in 2019, as at the third quarter, standing at N11.6 trillion compared to N9.6 trillion during the same period in 2018. This represented an annual growth rate of 21% between2018 and 2019.  The value of exports grew by 2.5% between 2018 and 2019 as at the third quarter, rising from N14 trillion to N14.4 trillion. nigeria’s foreign reserves now stand at $36.57 billion up from the $33.42 billion in April 2020 and it continues to grow as a result of the frugality of the Buhari administration. However, the message must be lost on Nigerians that it only in the atmosphere of peace, tranquility and unity that President Buhari can deliver more dividends of democracy and prudent governance. The late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, on the need for Nigerians to sow the seeds of peace and unity, described ``peace as a positive state of quiet and tranquility, a state of inter-state, inter-ethnic and inter-tribal harmony and equilibrium.’’ ``In unity’’, he said, ``we lose nothing, but our economic chains; indeed in unity, we gain many things …in division, we lose many things…mutually destructive hostilities among our ourselves and therefore urged:``Let us therefore remain united; and let us do so resolutely, faithfully and unflinchingly.’’ This is the least that Nigerians can give to their leader in exchange for a new lease of life and gains after pains. Another great Nigerian leader, the late President Shehu Shagari, a symbol of unity, left a legacy of peace for Nigerians, as he urged them to toe the path of peace and unity for national development, acting peace and talking peace in his life time. Dr Nnamidi Azikiwe, the first republic President of nigeria and  peacemaker and man of compromise in the interest of national cohesion and unity, also harped on maintaining nigeria’s unity. Zik’s principles are unambiguous: compromise, negotiation and accommodation -- to ease tension in the land and for peaceful co-existence. For the legacies of our progenitors to continue to hold sway, Nigerians and indeed their leaders – religious, political, traditional, students etc – should rally round President Buhari to follow through his `Next Level’ development agenda, not in a distraught environment, for the common good of nigeria and Nigerians.

Occasioned by the desire to manage the exposures of the now ubiquitous COVID 19 pandemic, the Akwa Ibom State Government reasonably scaled down activities to just a few vintage events.  Asides a thanksgiving service, Governor’s anniversary message broadcast, inauguration of a new Chairman of the State Council of Chiefs, an award event, flag-off of few projects, there was presentation of the state anthem, flag and emblem.We, the people of Akwa Ibom State, were partakers of these festivities, physically, remotely or merely by association. Together, we shared in the joy of the present, partly because we shared in the memory of the past. Believe me, there is a nexus connecting our experiences in the past to our experiments in the present and to our expectations of the future. This piece, in some constrained sense, aspires to reminisce our past experiences, reappraise our present experiments and consequently inspire a rethink of our future expectations. It seeks to interrogate the plausibility or otherwise of the recently kindled conversations about micro-zoning, in the build-up to 2023. Let us kick-start with the experience of the past.The Past:After the 1952 political maneuvers in the Western House of Assembly denied Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, a foremost pan-Nigerian politician from Eastern Region, the chance to be elected to the House of Representatives in Lagos, Dr. Azikiwe felt ethnically discriminated against and returned to the Eastern Region, where the N.C.N.C, his own party was also in control of the House of Assembly. His intention was to replace Prof. Eyo Ita, an Ibeno man from Calabar Province who was his second-in-command in N.C.N.C. and was leading in the Eastern House of Assembly at the time. There was an upset. There was a split. There were ethnic alliances and Dr. Azikiwe won in 1953. It was that bitter experience that further inspired the non-Igbo of Calabar, Ogoja and Rivers (COR) Provinces to resolve to organize themselves for a state or states of their own. The COR Movement was sired, led principally by Dr. Udo Udoma and others. In 1967, Cross River and Rivers States were created out of the COR Provinces. After the collapse of the Second Republic in 1983, a memorandum demanding the creation of Akwa Ibom State was submitted to the General Buhari-led administration by the Paramount Rulers of the 10 LGAs that made up the mainland part of the then Cross River State. Nothing happened still. The agitations continued and on Wednesday, September 23, 1987, the age-long dream of those who desired a Mainland State of Ibibio, Annang, Oron and others with headquarters in Uyo, came true with the creation of Akwa Ibom State by General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida.Though Akwa Ibom State was officially partitioned out from the old Cross River State in 1987, the aspiration for statehood stretched as far back as the 1930s. It was certainly not a walk through the highway but a crawl through a labyrinth. It was a slow, steady, long and tortuous journey for the survival of a people.At various defining moments in our collective past, Akwa Ibom State has been blessed with befitting leaders to steer its ship of state, either as military administrators or as elected governors. Col. Tunde Ogbeha was Akwa Ibom’s first military administrator and did his pioneering bits between September 28, 1987 and July 30, 1988. Between July 31, 1988 and September 5, 1990, Col. Godwin Abbe did his best to bring his predecessor’s plan out of the drawing board. When Abbe left, Idongesit Nkanga arrived as the first indigenous military administrator and turned things for good between September 5, 1990 and January 2, 1992. Same date, the first civilian Governor, Obong Akpan Isemin took over and began his revolutionary works, which were abruptly stalled by a military interregnum on November 18, 1993. On December 15, 1993, Lt. Col. Yakubu Bako began his time as the military administrator of the state and was replaced on August 21, 1996 by Joseph Adeusi, an Army officer who became the sixth Chief Executive Officer of the state. On August 9, 1998, Adeusi transmitted the baton to Group Captain John Ebiye, the witty, calm but strict disciplinarian who oversaw the military-to-civilian transition programme in the state.With the return and subsequent entrenchment of constitutional democracy in nigeria, Arc. Obong Victor Attah got elected and served for two terms between May 29, 1999 and May 29, 2007. That pioneering dispensation of visionary leadership, infrastructural renaissance and struggle for resource control was succeeded by an eight-year era of uncommon transformation and significant infrastructural development championed by another elected Governor, Chief Godswil Obot Akpabio, between May 29, 2007 to May 29, 2015. Then came the incumbent Chief Executive: Governor Udom Emmanuel.The Present:After a keenly contested election, Governor Udom Emmanuel took over the saddle of power on May 29, 2015, with a five-point agenda bordering on wealth creation, economic and political inclusion, poverty alleviation, infrastructural consolidation and expansion, as well as job creation. With the administration of Mr. Emmanuel now close to one and half years into its second term, the Government has brought in revolutionary leadership, massive industrialization and accelerated infrastructural development.At 33, while the incumbent Governor of Akwa Ibom State is putting his nose to the grindstone in his efforts to better the fortunes of the state at a critical time like now, some political gladiators had since begun scheming for the Governor’s successor, ahead of the closure of his second term by May, 2023. One way they do this is to stoke certain political conversations intended to stir up the polity and galvanize sentiments in favour of their interests. Let’s now interrogate one of such recently instigated conversations: Micro-zoning.The Future:Of late, some actors and gladiators in the state have sponsored a new conversation bordering on zoning and micro-zoning, with the subtle aim to court, coax or crimp palatable public sentiments for themselves or the interest(s) they represent.While some elders and stakeholders believe the time is not yet ripe for 2023-focused discussions, some others hold the position that there is nothing to even discuss at all, as it is already common knowledge that the next governor of Akwa Ibom State will emerge from Uyo Senatorial District. The later set are of the opinion that since the first round of rotation that coincided with the commencement of constitutional democracy in nigeria commenced with Obong Victor Attah from Uyo Senatorial District (1999-2007) and continued with Chief Godswill Akpabio from Ikot Ekpene Senatorial District (2007-2015) and is wrapping up with Mr. Udom Emmanuel from Eket Senatorial District (2015-2023); another cycle of rotation should naturally begin with Uyo Senatorial District. The position is further stretched to imply that since Senatorial District with a mix of ethnic considerations sufficed in 1999, 2007 and 2015, any attempt to micro-zone the office to any specific Federal Constituency within USD by 2023 may tantamount to shifting the goalpost in the middle of a game.Conversely, some elders from Itu/Ibiono Federal Constituency are of the opinion that since Uyo Federal Constituency in 1999 produced Obong Attah from Ibesikpo Asutan who served the State for eight years, the hilltop seat in 2023 should be micro-zoned to Itu/Ibiono Federal Constituency. Arrowheads of this proposition further argue that since Etinan Federal Constituency took a bite at the plum job in 1992 through the Late Obong Akpan Isemin whose tenure was aborted due to the 1993 military interregnum, Etinan Federal Constituency should just ‘calm down’.Some stakeholders and elders of Etinan Federal Constituency have admitted that even though they are yet to meet as a bloc to decide their fate on their 2023 expectation, they strongly believe 2023 should afford them the opportunity to consolidate on the victory of Obong Isemin who was duly elected but was not allowed to serve, following the 1993 military take-over by Gen. Sani Abacha. Those in this school of thought believe Etinan Federal Constituency (comprising of Etinan, Nsit Ibom and Nsit Ubium LGAs) should be favoured for the role the Federal Constituency has played since after the premature abortion of Isemin’s mandate, in supporting others and deepening the fabrics of democracy in Akwa Ibom State.Meanwhile, there are those from Uyo Federal Constituency who also believe the Federal Constituency may somehow still gain access to the hilltop scepter, by some stroke of luck.To drive home their various persuasions, a few stakeholders particularly of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have begun to call on the incumbent Governor and the leadership of their party to convene roundtable talks to allow them vent their sentiments on the triune issues of zoning, micro-zoning or zero-zoning. Weighing into this conversation, the Ink Newspaper, in its September 22, 2020 edition, reportedly submitted that while these conversations are ongoing, its checks revealed that the PDP would likely foreclose the chances of Uyo Federal Constituency joining the governorship race in 2023, but was likely to allow an open contest amongst contenders from Etinan Federal Constituency and Itu/Ibiono Federal Constituency and that a deputy governor would likely be picked from Oro Federal Constituency, while Ikot Ekpene may get Speaker of the State Assembly.End Notes:But as I begin to draw the curtains, let me let you interrogate for yourself the plausibility or otherwise of the mumbles over micro-zoning. Before one gets consumed in the ensuing hullabaloos in the days ahead, one may need to pause and intelligently ponder on some issues. Here are a few posers. Micro-zoning, zoning, zero-zoning: What difference does it make? Is the time yet ripe for these conversations? If there were no micro-zoning considerations in 1999, 2007 and 2015, why now? What do the promoters of micro-zoning seek to gain? In 2023, what kind of leader is fit to lead the new Akwa Ibom? What should his or her qualifications and antecedents be?My end notes therefore are: 1. Let us focus less on the next election but more on the next generation. 2. Let us border less on trivialities, banalities and mundanities but more on the basic requirements for good governance. 3. Let us argue less over cosmetic issues and think more on things that can better our lots as a people. And 4. Let our considerations for the next leader of a Post COVID 19 Akwa Ibom be hinged on these critical three: Character, Competence and Capacity.  God bless Akwa Ibom!"

Osinbajo disclosed this while speaking during a webinar organised by The Africa Report.The webinar, which was themed ‘Bouncing back: nigeria’s post-pandemic recovery plan’, focused on issues regarding government frameworks to be adopted towards economic recovery following the Coronavirus pandemic, which affected countries globally.Reacting to a question on the continued closure of the land borders despite preparations for the implementation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), the Vice President said the government was working with neighbouring countries on the terms of reopening the border.He said, “We are working with our neighbours to see on what terms we would reopen those borders. At the moment, we are undertaking joint border patrols to control smuggling along the borders and we think it is working and I am sure that soon enough we should have the borders opened.“We are committed to the AfCFTA but we are concerned about threats to security and the economy and we had to take certain actions that would satisfy the immediate needs of our country. It (border closure) certainly wasn’t meant to be permanent and we are looking forward to reopening as quickly as possible.”President Muhammadu Buhari had in October 2019 ordered the closure of the borders to check the menace of smuggling goods and arms and ammunition into the country and protect local businesses.The closure was, however, greeted by mixed reactions from professional organisations, economists and individuals.Heads of countries like Ghana and Benin Republic had also appealed to the President to reconsider the closure, but Buhari maintained that the borders would remain closed until the final report of the committee set up on the matter was considered.http://saharareporters.com/2020/09/27/nigeria-reopen-land-borders-soon-%E2%80%93vice-president-osinbajo"

989,,,"Raid on AKS Market: PDP Knocks APC Over Comments on Governor EmmanuelThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Akwa Ibom state, has lambasted the All Progressive Congress (APC) over what it  described as the opposition party's comment on Governor Udom Emmanuel on the issue of the raid on a market in the state by men alleged to be security operatives attached to the ""Operation Swift Response"" Speaking through its Publicity Secretary, Borono Bassey, the Akwa Ibom state chapter of PDP, lashed out on the APC, pointing that an earlier release signed by the APC spokesperson, rather than indict Governor Emmanuel, amounted to an effort to by the APC to spit on the federal government, having referred to a night raid in an Akwa Ibom popular market by federal government security agents, as an armed robbery attack.The release by the Akwa Ibom State PDP Spokesman read ""Patriotic Akwa Ibom people, on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 – while in the euphoria of the 33rd Anniversary of State creation, witnessed a reprehensible attempt by the All Progressives Congress, APC, Akwa Ibom State, to exhibit a behaviour that is common to cavemen.The APC, in an inexcusable display of gratuitous ignorance through a bland release, made strenuous but failed efforts to accuse the Governor Udom Emmanuel-led administration of not reacting to the supposed “raid” on the popular Itam Market by persons the stopgap Publicity Secretary of the APC, referred to as armed bandits.  The APC Publicity Secretary, through that release, effortlessly earned for himself and the remaining few members of his party, a shining badge in the courageous display of unbridled ignorance. Through a little effort of research and facts-checking, the APC spokesman would have realized that he only succeeded in spitting on the APC-led Federal Government by authoring the said release. Credible intelligence and news reports have shown that the said raid on Itam Market which the APC spokesman claimed was an armed robbery attack, was actually one in the series of the raids carried out by men of the ""Operation Swift Response""( Coordinated by the Office of the National Security Adviser) in a border drill exercise commissioned by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government. (Find the report of the raid as published by Nation Newspaper here:https://thenationonlineng.net/traders-decry-raid-of-itam-market-by-customs-officials/) These border drill exercises have ""curiously"" flowed into major markets around the country like Lagos, Adamawa among others, with many traders having their goods confiscated. (Find more information on the seizures of goods here:https://guardian.ng/news/fg-makes-n11b-seizures-from-border-closure-in-one-year/). Our painstaking checks have also shown that it has become the tradition of the men of the Operation Swift Response as Coordinated by the Office of the National Security Adviser, to sometimes carry out raids like the one at Itam market at night. We understand that for the handful of members of the APC in Akwa Ibom State currently dwelling in a political cave on account of the banishment Akwa Ibom electorate had sent them, access to credible information on the goings-on in the real world is a luxury they are unable to afford. Therefore, we will not fail to advise them to always send a member out to confirm the real truth about the present state of things in our state, nigeria and the world before proceeding to compete in the ""one-party Olympics of Ignorance"" they constantly organise. We must remind the Akwa Ibom APC that Governor Udom Emmanuel, who is the leader of the Peoples Democratic Party in Akwa Ibom State is indeed too busy with the actualization of the Completion Agenda for our people and so cannot be distracted by the perennial hisses of a banished party. We are confident that soon enough, the remaining handful of APC members in Akwa Ibom State will regain freedom from the chains in the cave of darkness which they currently exist and step into the light. When this happens, everything that represents the metaphors in Plato's Allegory of the Cave will manifest in their lives.""Cc: Lalasticlala"

Firstly, the Lagos Ibadan express road which you mentioned was constructed in 1978 by Obj.  The money collected from tollgates until the the tollgates were dismantled was enough to reconstruct that road. No industry was sited on that road because Lagos was the capital and the management needs to be closer to FG. 99.5% of the industries or businesses on that road were established several years after capital was moved to Abuja and Lagos abandoned. In Africa and other part of the world capitals have been relocated. Lagos had been a trade hub before amalgamation of North and South of Niger. When Calabar was nigeria Capital, Lagos had been a trade hub. Lagos is the gateway to many countries. I was at Alaba Rago on Friday, despite border closure, businesses were going on between trucks going to Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Niger, Gambia, Ghana, Benin Republic, Togo. Alaba Rago is Hausa wing of the Alaba market. In Computer Village and Alaba electronics, they have patronages from people from different nations. This has nothing to do with Lagos as Capital but because it is a West Africa Hub. I have seen goods at Onne Port marked NGA/LOS (nigeria / Lagos) and asked why goods shipped to Onne Port still bears NGA/LOS, I was told at the factories, that was the identification marker for goods coming to nigeria. Also, there are some shipping companies that only shipped to Lagos. Lagos to Accra is shorter than Lagos to Abuja. Goods produced in Lagos or goods marketed in Lagos have wide patronage as a Land, Sea and Air international border. A city that hardly sleeps. Most of those industries on Lagos / Ibadan express road came almost one or two decades after capital has been moved. The rate of returns on investment (ROI) on that road is very high and Payback period would be very short. Lagos carries nigeria burden.

It should be noted that only fully paid common stocks are included in the NSE30 index. The index is usually rebalanced on semi-annual basis, on the first working day in January and in July.Companies presently listed on the NSE30 Index include:• BANKS: GTBank Plc, Zenith Bank Plc, Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc, Access Bank Plc, UBA Plc, FBN Holdings, Union Bank of nigeria Plc, Ecobank Transnational Inc, Fidelity Bank Plc, FCMB Group Plc, Sterling Bank Plc.• FMCGs: Nestle nigeria, Nigerian Breweries Plc, Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc, Unilever nigeria Plc, Guinness nigeria Plc, International Breweries Plc, Flour Mills of nigeria Plc.• OIL & GAS: Seplat petroleum Development Co.

These stocks also have attractive upside potential for 2020 based on our target prices, and are relatively consistent with dividend payments.Notably, ZENITH and UBA have dividend yield that exceeds inflation levels. GUARANTY and STANBIC are also likely to offer dividend yield that are higher than the return on one-year T-Bill, going by their first-half performances. These banking names all announced interim dividends for the first half of the year.In the cement space, WAPCO and DANGCEM are currently trading at attractive prices in the market, despite strong earnings expectations for FY20. Both companies delivered impressive growth in profit after tax (DANGCEM, +5.8% YoY; WAPCO, + 60.0% YoY) in H1 2020, despite the COVID-19 impact on sales (principally noticed in April).DANGCEM and WAPCO are trading at 23.6% and 35.8% discounts respectively, to their 5-year average P/Es, despite expectations of higher ROEs in 2020.There is also a strong investment case for PRESCO and OKOMUOIL, as oil palm companies historically thrive during currency liquidity crisis in nigeria. Recall that OKOMU and PRESCO grew profits by over 100.0% YoY and 82.0% YoY respectively in 2016. border closure and potential FX-induced increase in domestic patronage are other arguments in favor of the sectorLastly, NESTLE is an obvious pick from the consumer goods space. The company has demonstrated high defensive attributes of consistent dividend payments and superior ROE (73.9% compared to a sector average of 27.6%), amidst macro headwinds of the last few years. Its healthy reliance on locally sourced raw materials makes an additional case for the stock, given recent naira pressure.In addition, Silas Ozoya, Managing Partner, SUBA Capital, in a chat with Nairametrics, used the prevailing macros in selecting his favorite NSE30 stocks.“My personal favorites are in the financial sector and consumer goods. This is because transactions happen every day and humans must consume house hold items. So, my first pick would be Zenith Bank, GTBank, and Sterling Bank. They are the stocks to hold in my portfolio, because of pond standing stability in the case of Zenith Bank and GTBank, and rapid growth in the case of Sterling Bank,” he said.Also, the consumer goods market is the next on his list. “Unilever, Flour Mills of Nigerian Plc, and Nestle would top my list here, because of the market and consumer behavior towards their products, which translates to a healthy bottom, capitalization, and dividend,” he added.Overall, the leadership of these companies, and their response to the ever-changing policies have shown how much longer they’re willing to keep the business running, which is a priority for any investor holding shares in their portfolio.SOURCE (abridged): https://nairametrics.com/2020/09/16/top-nse30-stocks-you-should-consider-buying/"

The first section traces CBN’s poor crisis management between 2015 and 2017, which is similar to its COVID-19 response. The last section focuses on its weak response to the NESG in light of the institutions’ recent publication on issues facing the Nigerian economy. Skip to the sections you want. Pardon errors, rushed and unedited.Earlier in the year, when the impact of COVID-19 was becoming evident, I wrote a thread on how the biggest challenge facing us would be CBN’s communication problem and policies. I have been mostly correct.This prediction was not because I was smart or could see the future. It is simply what you expect from a Bank that has left a trail of communication failings in its wake in the past five years. History might not the best predict the future, but with the current CBN, the thinking seems stuck in the past with no room for new learning.The CBN said there would be no devaluation only to devalue some days later. The Bank has also attacked importers, exporters and BDC operators. This is a playbook from the past and bad policies seem to be on a timeless loop.A Communication Disasterclass between 2015 and 2017Before I go into the CBN’s latest tantrums about NESG’s 15-point highlight of issues facing nigeria, let me talk about the trail of CBN’s communication problems during the last crisis between 2015 and 2017.In February 2015, Premium Times talked about the widening premium at the parallel market after the devaluation in September 2014 was below market expectation. The paper also wrote about how foreign investors, in this case, JP Morgan, complained about illiquidity in the FX markets that deterred the entry and exit of foreign investors. JP Morgan had threatened to delist nigeria from its index, which emerging market investors looked at before making decisions. The CBN responded to both issues, it was important to do so due to capital flows. The CBN Governor stated that the Bank would do everything possible to prevent delisting. In the same month, the CBN devalued from N169/$ to N197/$.Post-2015 elections and after two devaluations (November 2014 and February 2015) driven by the oil price crash in mid-2014, the CBN later decided that a devaluation was a bad thing to do. In the linked article, the position of the President and Vice-President, people who should have no control over monetary policy, was used as justification by the CBN. This reduced liquidity in the market and the Bank implemented capital controls (policies that made it difficult for investors to bring in USD and exit).Much later, JP Morgan eventually delisted nigeria. In classic fashion, the CBN which took measures to prevent an exit, worked with the DMO to release a bombastic circular on how that delisting meant nothing and would have no impact. Much later, the impact would be seen in the record moderation in capital importation into nigeria as foreign investors turned away. The only other time nigeria has had worse investment numbers is this year, no thanks to COVID-19 and the CBN’s poor response.As economic conditions worsened despite the CBN talking down a devaluation, blaming speculators and importers, sponsoring tweets to attack analysts on Twitter and cutting down trees to stem the fall in the currency, the Bank eventually devalued mid-2016 and in early 2017. In early 2017, the CBN created the I&E window to entice foreign investors that they claimed did not matter less than two years earlier. Between 2017 and 2019, the CBN destroyed its balance sheet by selling securities to this same foreign investors to attract USD flows.From going against a devaluation and peddling myths against a devaluation, the CBN adjusted from N197/$ to N365/$ in two years. All along the way, communication was poor and inconsistent and the consequences were dire. Doctors are some times jailed for malpractice, not policymakers who spread poverty and destroy businesses.CBN’s Tantrums at NESG’s Take on Recent Economic ChallengesNow to the important issue. I am sure most of us have read the NESG’s take on recent issues in nigeria. This was a very measured consideration of issues facing nigeria and I am surprised by the CBN’s sensational reaction which would be hilarious if not sad. The quality of the response and the language were disappointing, to say the least. In the following paragraphs, I will walk you through the CBN’s poor understanding of issues and deliberate misrepresentation of facts.On Weak Growth and CBN’s COVID-19 ResponseBelow is what the CBN has to say on the performance of the economy. The major point is that the CBN claims to have staved off a worse performance unlike in India, US, and SA.The CBN says analysts expected a decline in GDP of 7.4% in Q2 but the actual was better at -6.1% due to their measures. This is hilarious because the same CBN expected (PDF: Page 3, last second to the last paragraph) a contraction of just 1.03%. So why is the CBN praising itself for a contraction of 6.1% when they expected a decline of just 1.03%?Also, the CBN tried to imply that nigeria did well because SA’s GDP declined by 52% in Q2. What the CBN did not mention was that SA calculates its growth numbers differently. If you assume the same methodology as nigeria’s, SA’s performance was a decline of around 17%, still bad but obviously way off 52% innit?Finally, it was convenient that the CBN chose countries doing much worse. There are countries likely to have outperformed nigeria in Q2 - peers such as Ghana, Kenya and Egypt.On CBN’s COVID-19 DisbursementsThe CBN claims that its development finance activities are felt by Nigerians and the justification provided is hilarious.You don’t need to be smart to see this as pure nonsense. Who takes credit for disbursing N59.1bn to households and businesses in a country where consumer spending is N107.7tn annually and the contribution of SMEs exceeds 50% (over N70.0tn) of GDP? The Bank’s intervention is clearly too negligible to have an impact, nice try though.On the Inadequacy of Monetary Disbursement to FarmersAt this point, I am convinced the CBN operates in an alternate reality. The Bank is claiming that its intervention programmes have ensured that nigeria is not facing a food crisisThis shows the CBN is disconnected from the reality of the average Nigerian, nor do they take notice of facts available. The latest price watch of the NBS (see image below) as of July 2020 shows that nigeria is indeed in the middle of a food crisis. Or how else do you justify these price changes over a one year period? Food insecurity in nigeria is similar to what is obtainable in war-torn countries, I wrote about it here a year ago. It’s getting worse. One would expect a CBN with an inflation target of 6-9% to know better in a country where inflation is 12.8% and rising.This shows the CBN is disconnected from the reality of the average Nigerian, nor do they take notice of facts available.

One would expect a CBN with an inflation target of 6-9% to know better in a country where inflation is 12.8% and rising.On NESG’s claim that the lending process is not ideal, the CBN noted that there was adequate due diligence and pricing of risk. This is not honest. Many farmers claim not to have received disbursement. Some complain that disbursement is usually slow and after the planting season. And for those with access, the farmers have failed to repay back the loans disbursed under the Anchor Borrower’s Programme, for instance. Premium Times, Business Day and Guardian have all reported it extensively. So why is the CBN claiming that it is a successful programme when loans are not properly disbursed and they are mostly not repaid?Beyond agriculture, even the COVID-19 support offered to businesses and households through Nirsal was disbursed through a poor lending process. There are beneficiaries who allegedly never submitted complete documents but received credit alerts! There is a problem with the CBN’s approach to development financing and there is no evidence that it works.On Trade and border closureI am not surprised that this is the best response the CBN could provide for the extended closure of borders which has had devastating consequences. It is hard to defend poor policies.In an economy with needs for new sources of FX other than from oil, why is it reasonable to ban exports to neighbouring countries? When did it become economic sabotage to export products? A lot of Nigerian manufacturers have been affected by the closure of land borders, including those importing raw materials needed for finished goods that are exported.Then why should the desire to block “harmful and illicit trade” affect “genuine” ones? In what planet does it make sense to impose a 70% tariff on a staple such as rice and also restrict FX for its import? Yet with all these anti-trade policies, if local rice production is still not competitive, shouldn’t this bring about a new approach?What is clear is that it doesn’t make sense to create barriers to imports when domestic production is grossly inadequate. We have seen it with rice, it is also now evident with poultry products, as the CBN’s decision to stop selling FX to maize importers is creating problems.The welfare impact of the border closure is well captured by this snapshot from the World Bank.On the Lack of Clarity on FX, and poor FX ManagementCBN’s management of the FX crisis has not inspired confidence. The failure to adopt a timely adjustment of the exchange rate in the face of reduced FX availability has resulted in a wide premium at the parallel market. The CBN also stopped sales to BDCs and the I&E FX window - what is supposed to be the market-reflective segment - since March 2020. In a market with weak supply and many prices (exchange rates) which create the room for arbitrage, it shouldn’t be hard to see how FX allocation would be inefficient and how economic activities would be disrupted.On Interest Rate Management, Saving and PensionsYou won’t be wrong to think that the economists at the CBN with PhDs probably got their certifications by way of an affidavit with this response.What the NESG alluded to was the challenges with low-interest rates or yields (treasury bills and bonds) in nigeria, with rates on treasury bills around 2-3% and significantly below inflation at around 12.8%. In a country where the currency is losing value, this will result in loss of confidence and saving becomes less attractive to businesses and consumers. However, a high level of domestic saving is needed to boost investment and growth. Similarly, in a country with no safety nets, a negative real return (inflation > interest rates) would affect pension returns and the welfare of retirees in the future.Yet the content of the above image is what the CBN offered as an explanation, redirecting the conversation to its recent policy which reduced interest rate on savings deposits. To be clear, the interest rate on savings deposits has always been poor relative to inflation. Before the latest change to 10% of MPR (the benchmark interest rate for the country) which is 1.25%, it was a minimum of 30% of MPR which was 3.8%. The rate was 4.2% between 2016 and 2020 when MPR was 14.0% while inflation averaged >13.0%. That clearly isn’t the point.The CBN’s claim that because saving must equal investment, deposits must then be close to loans is a reach. The saving must equal investment equation, in theory, is for a closed economy. While our land borders are shut, we are not a closed economy. Saving in that context is also not the same as deposits, nor can loans be close to investment. Saving refers to the part of your income that is not consumed. If I borrow money from Wema Bank and deposit in GTB, does that count as saving too just because it is a deposit? Loans can be for all sorts of uses. It can be used to pay salaries, buy gadgets, purchase clothes, buy machinery, among other uses. But investment is actually spending on durable goods with uses beyond a year. How then should loans be close to investment?Still on the Bank claims that total deposits should be close to total credit. Well, how will this be possible if the mandatory CRR (share of deposits kept with the CBN) is 27.5% while the actual CRR has recently surpassed 50.0% due to arbitrary debits?This has been a long read and I am going to stop here. Clearly, the CBN chose to be sensational rather than react sensibly to the issues raised by the NESG. The CBN demonstrates a poor understanding of issues and tries to mislead with its response to the NESG. There were many other valid issues raised that were unaddressed. Without a doubt, competent people are needed at the CBN.Comments and questions are welcome.

INSENSITIVITY  IN  LAGOS @VONNEWS              In order to press home it's demand for a better society where peace and prosperity reign, a group, the Ambassadors for Peace And  Enlightenment Foundation and micro - Entrepreneurs of nigeria (APEF), recently marched against human rights abuse, poverty and general hardship in Lagos; a protest March which took them through the streets of Lagos.               APEF which comprises of various professionals, such as journalists and lawyers have remained a strong Voice against all forms of injustice and Leadership, a misclemeanor since its inception organised this latest protest due to the heightening difficulty in nigeria, especially Nigerians who are still enmeshed in the challenges imposed by the pandemic lockdown.                                 The president of APEF, Comrade Prince Saviour while addressing the media men during the protest said that the untold hardship caused by border closure, and the failure of govt to address the causes of suffering gave rise to the protest, stressing that nigeria's inability to create an enabling environment where industries can grow for employment and the manufacturing of goods for export and local use has resulted to the increase in crime. Nigerians have to  survive with a currency with little or no value.              Speaking further, he noted that the time for the masses to arise and stage a unified protest is now, when the cost of living is so biting, pointing that it is inexplicable and quite unacceptable that this administration has imposed more pain on citizenry by hiking petroleum and power  tariffs, at a time when the pandemic has forced many firms to close down, and  many out of job.              Emphasising the role APEF has played in economic empowerment, rights enlightenment and entrepreneural development, he asserted that APEF has been recognised by the Lagos State Ministry of Education which has already written the organization to be free to train schools on human rights.               Finally he urged government to look in the direction of the challenges emanating from border closure, and to see how opportunities for employment can be enhanced, especially through the agro sector which holds, numerous benefits economically, condemning the recent increase of the pump price of petrol, as  well as the electricity tariff hike which they noted as signs of government insensitivity to the plights of the people.By  Onome Naomi"

This is with a view to discover the missing link, where and when we got it all wrong – Water, Education, Power, Agriculture, Health, Manufacturing, National Institutions. When was the last time you watched a Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) Programme, was there any noticeable improvement from what you have known it to be? Did nigeria ever show the promise of a great nation? As an optimist, I sometimes struggle to see how the nigeria of my dreams will be birthed. The late erudite Professor, Pius Adesanmi once wrote that the reason why he published articles on the Nigerian state was for Archeology purposes, to show that not all Nigerians looked away when her leaders showed no vision and sailed with the wind. It is the same with this article, it is to register my displeasure on how our Nation is being run.The reality of the Nigerian state is best described as a Nightmare. How did we end up being represented by ill-equipped and self-serving individuals? To use the current leadership as an example, how did a supposed Integrity hero manage to head a government whose legacies reek of corruption and corrupt practices? How did successive generations manage to sow discord and hate in their young? A visit to the politics thread on Nairaland (nigeria's most visited online forum) reveals the deep hatred the Igbos and the Yorubas have for one another. For how long will nigeria remain a bad dream? The realities of Covid-19 forced our leaders to have a taste of their evil deeds; some of them did not survive the border closure. Ironically, the typical Nigerian politician will not learn any lesson from the COVID experience. They are waiting for COVID to pass and get back to their normal way of life. A letter recently credited to the First Lady, after her return from a medical-related trip confirms this position.If the Nigerian story was a movie, the scriptwriter would have won multiple awards for documenting a brilliant horror story and the actors recognized for a flawless show of evil, ruthlessness and terror – with exception to a few actors.The Major political parties are structured to present undesirable candidates for elective positions, leaving the electorate a hard job of choosing between the devil and the deep blue sea. Our electoral laws and set up makes it difficult for private candidates to have any chance at the polls. For a long time, our education system remains on life support. This is not for a lack of Educational Policies, but a lack of implementation and leadership. The realities of COVID-19 underscore the importance of ICT Infrastructure to support blended learning. These infrastructures are non-existent in our tertiary institutions, needless to say in the public Secondary and Primary institutions. Undoubtedly, we need a revolution to birth the nigeria of our dreams. Be part of this revolution by being a good leader and citizen in whatever position you find yourself. Do not abuse your office; use your influence for the common good. Lead from the front; be accountable and transparent in your dealings. More importantly, a critical mass of the Nigerian Stakeholders must come together to set up mechanisms to engage and hold our leaders to account across board – at the Local, State and Federal levels.The tragedy of the Nigerian nation is one of leadership, men and women best described as mediocre with no moral pedigree continue to dominate and dictate how our nation is run. Their strategy is simple but it continues to work, to ride on the people and divide them along the fault lines of ethnicity and religion whilst plundering our national and collective wealth. nigeria has been a bad dream and Nightmare.Please, Wake me up. Wake me up."

1057,,,"Dele Momodu‌Popular journalist and Publisher, Ovation Media Group, Chief Dele Momodu, shares with TUNDE AJAJA his thoughts on the recent closure of shops belonging to some Nigerians in Ghana and nigeria’s diplomatic relationsGhana is like your second home, could you share with us how your bond with Ghana started?On July 22, 1995, some people came to my house in Ojodu, Lagos and alerted my wife to an imminent danger that awaited me. The government of the late General Sani Abacha decided that I should be declared wanted and arrested. I was accused of being one of the brains behind a private radio station initially known as Radio Freedom and later changed to Radio Kudirat. But the truth is that I didn’t know anything about it. However, you know that during Abacha’s regime, there was no room for argument and if you were in the country in such circumstances, anything could happen. If it was during Gen Ibrahim Babangida’s regime, I could have managed, after all, during his regime, I was put in detention briefly and that one was okay (laughs).But with Abacha, anything could have happened, so I had to plan my escape. On July 25, I left nigeria through the bush to Seme border to Cotonou and then to Lome in Togo and from there to Accra, Ghana. That was my first time in Ghana, but instantly, I loved what I saw. I spent three days there and left for London on July 28, 1995. I landed at Gatwick Airport, London the following morning. Thus began my exile in London. I was able to prove that my life was in danger, so the British government protected me and my family; my wife and only son at that time managed to also escape. They were nearly arrested at the airport but were allowed to go. The British were good to me and it was there I started Ovation.At what point did you return to Ghana?I was there for three years as a refugee. By the time I was leaving England for Ghana, I was so excited because I never liked to live in Europe. Life there was routine; if you pay attention, the same bus you board today might be the same bus you would board in the next 20 to 30 years and many things would never change. I just couldn’t cope with such a cacophonous existence. Once I had the chance to go back to Ghana, I did and was very delighted to make Ghana part of my home. I decided to have an office in Ghana and we launched Ovation there.At what point did things go wrong again between nigeria and Ghana?Ghanaians are very sensitive about Nigerians, partly due to the skirmishes we had in the past. First, Ghanaians chased Nigerians out of their country in 1969. And in 1983, the late President Shehu Shagari sacked Ghanaians from nigeria, in what was known then as ‘Ghana Must Go’. While Nigerians have forgotten that they were once chased out of Ghana, we only remember ‘Ghana Must Go’, so Ghanaians never forgave us and they never forgot. Till today, they are still very sensitive about that episode. Also, they find Nigerians to be very loud; we are like the Americans of Africa and so wherever we go, not just Ghana, people notice us, and we speak in loud voices and people would think you are quarrelling or fighting them. A Ghanaian can almost break down in tears if you shout at them; they don’t like it, but Nigerians are not like that.I call Ghana little Europe because it’s a very organised, beautiful and peaceful society. I probably know Ghana more than nigeria and I have travelled to every part of Ghana by road, up to Wa, which is probably the farthest part of Ghana. Ghana has been very blessed with good leaders; intelligent, brilliant and cerebral, but the biggest problem, which is the sore point, is always this unhealthy rivalry between them and nigeria. Our students spend so much money to go to school in Ghana and yet Ghanaians always complain that they are too loud, boisterous, flamboyant and I always remind them that for anybody to bring dollars to spend in Ghana, they must be children of the elite and they should not use a few of them to judge the rest of us.Since you have been close to almost all their leaders, were there times you raised some of these issues with them, maybe during your casual conversations?Being friends with a leader does not mean you are both discussing countries, because I wasn’t there as a representative of the government, so our discussions would not go along those lines. The discussion would usually be in terms of business, tourism and such things, but nothing political. The closest to me has been John Mahama, whom I can discuss anything with and my attraction was because he was far advanced than most African leaders in terms of infrastructural development.However, I realise that Ghanaians did not mind us coming as tourists but they do not want us to come as investors. If you are going to invest, don’t live in Ghana and if you must invest, it must be at the highest level and not as a trader. You cannot like our money and not like our face. Sometimes too, we are careless and we take many things for granted. That is the attitude that led to this trouble. That was why they started erecting all kinds of obstacles on the path of our traders. Otherwise, why did they say $300,000 initially and suddenly they took it to $1m. How? If a man has $1m, will he leave his country? With that amount, you would still get a good property in Banana Island. Even in Beverly Hills in Los Angeles, if you have $1m cash you are a king. Then, we started seeing videos of them attacking Nigerians and I got angry. From time to time, there have been skirmishes but not this pronounced before now, though it gets worse when their election is approaching, which is on December 7. I think that is what has caused this present one, but like I said, they haven’t forgiven us for the ‘Ghana Must Go’ era. They might not mention it but I think somehow that is the underlying factor. That bitterness is still there, and then they believe Nigerians are boastful and flamboyant while they don’t like too much noise. They also believe that Nigerians are bringing money to corrupt their people, especially women.At some point, you also lost your money and investment, could you tell us more about it?I lost a lot of money there when I invested in a restaurant. I believe it was one of the most magnificent restaurants in Ghana and it was in line with the Ovation signature of quality. When we were opening the restaurant, it was a high-profile event that lasted two nights. Our concept was for Nigerians to have a restaurant they could go to. We had a massage parlour upstairs and when your food was being prepared, you could go there for a complementary treat. However, I found out that Ghanaians were getting angry more and more and I came one day to see that my restaurant had been shut down. I couldn’t believe it.What were your findings?We went to the Ghana Investment Promotion Council. I had never heard about a situation where an agency that is supposed to encourage investment and investors would be the one shutting down businesses. I asked what my offence was and nobody could tell me anything. For over two weeks, they shut it down and everything in the restaurant got spoilt. All I got at the end of the day was a verbal apology. The man in charge of the agency looked at me and asked ‘Chief, who have you offended?’ and I said how would I know? I had all the approvals, but you won’t believe that there was nothing in my file when I got to their office. That was why the man asked that question. My good friend, the late Alhaji Aliu Mahama, was the vice-president of Ghana and I called him but he couldn’t help. He said he would investigate but nothing happened. My godfather, Alhaji Asuma Banda, one of the richest people, could not solve it too. He drove there to find out what Dele did wrong, nobody could tell him. We all became frustrated. You know if you have information, you would know how to go about it, but nobody would talk to you.But your friend, the vice-president, could have intervened and ensure they opened the restaurant, especially since you were not found to have violated any law?No, they don’t have such a culture in Ghana. The vice-president does not have such powers. It’s not like nigeria. You know they have a very strong radio; they would have descended on him. They might even claim he was selling out his country to Nigerians. So, he couldn’t do anything. The worst part is that in October 2006, I transferred money ($60,000) duly approved by the Bank of Ghana to South Africa to order for my industrial catering equipment because I wanted it to be the best. The equipment arrived at the Tema Port (Ghana) in January 2007 but it wasn’t cleared until 2010. It’s hard to believe it. From the 2006 that I placed the order, I did not set my eyes on the equipment until 2010 and I couldn’t use most of the items again. I had to go and buy other equipment locally, and their tariffs were so high. Eventually, I lost all my investments.Did they eventually reopen the restaurant?It was reopened, but by then the deed had been done. I had to move it to another location but it never really survived. I had to shut it down. It is a sad one. Even Ovation magazines, I had to stop taking them directly to Ghana. So, we would first bring them to nigeria and because the magazines were printed in English and French, we would take the French copies by road to Benin Republic and Togo, and then we would take the English copies to Ghana. Every border you get to, they want to charge tariff, on magazines? How much can you sell a magazine? When you get to Ghana is when you face the highest tariff you can imagine. At the end of the day, what it would cost me to get my magazine to Ghana would be more than the cover price of the magazine sometimes, so that was how I got discouraged.What other business would I do then? I lost thousands of dollars to Ghana. It was a total waste. Given my connection to the British, I registered with the British investors in Ghana and they were very organised. Most of them were white investors from the UK. We had a club house where we met for meetings. One day, I was sharing my experience with them and one of our members, a white man, marvelled at what I went through; he said he had been in Ghana for over 20 years and he never had such an experience. He said he didn’t even have to register a company. I felt so scandalised, wondering how I, an African, who was also fighting tooth and nail to promote them, was faced with such problems. The same thing happens in South Africa; if you have a British passport and you want to visit South Africa, you don’t need a visa but if you want to go as a Nigerian, you have to wait and wait to get a visa. For Ghana, former President John Mahama was very kind; he was the one who liberalised their visa process and said Africans could get visas at the point of entry.nigeria’s President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) and the presidents of these other countries that are hostile to Nigerians meet from time to time, could it be that they don’t talk about these things?Don’t forget that a lot of our presidents, especially in nigeria, are largely ceremonial. They are not properly briefed, not because they can’t be briefed, but because their aides are even sometimes afraid to talk to them. They have nothing to discuss. A lot of people have complained that a lot of the ministers don’t see President Buhari and he himself actually gave a hint when he said during the time of Mallam Abba Kyari, his late Chief of Staff, that they should go through his Chief of Staff. That is part of the problem. If you have a president that is accessible, who they can explain these things to and he would understand them, that would have helped.Also, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, would not have gone to Ghana if he had not got a tacit approval from the presidency. If the President had told him that Ghana was maltreating our people and that we couldn’t go there now until the issues were resolved, he wouldn’t have gone. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo would not have allowed such. He is so respected in Ghana that the longest street in Accra is named after him – Olusegun Obasanjo Way. So, nobody would try such with Obasanjo; it’s not possible, because he understands foreign policy. But, perhaps, if any president in Africa calls him (President Buhari) and massages his ego and tells him, ‘Baba, the issue is not like that,’ he would believe them because foreign policy is not his forte. If this interview gets to his desk, I’m hoping that as someone who supported him in the past, he would allow his officials or knowledgeable people to help him. He has a lot of bright minds in his cabinet.You have a vice-president who would have handled all these things for you perfectly, but if you don’t give him that task, he can’t go there on his own. People like (Babatunde) Fashola, who used to go to Ghana to play football as the Chief of Staff to former governor Tinubu, are there too. So Baba (Buhari) desperately needs to wake up in terms of foreign policy. His foreign policy is the weakest that I know. Diplomacy is not about nice words; it’s about reciprocity. I studied it a bit and I read reports internationally. If I wanted to be the president of nigeria, definitely, I must know a bit about everything. We are not pursuing diplomacy of reciprocity, and if you don’t pursue it, it means people would take advantage of us all the time. What people are doing is to take advantage of nigeria’s weakness. For example, the day Buhari threatens to pull out of ECOWAS, you would see that everybody would catch a cold, because nigeria substantially runs some of those organisations. We are the biggest investor.If you were Buhari, what would you have done when the story about the maltreatment of Nigerians in Ghana broke?If I were Buhari, last week I would have suspended our relationship with ECOWAS; let all the presidents in ECOWAS go and talk to their colleague in Ghana to relax. Like I said, diplomacy is not about nice words. You can’t say you are in ECOWAS and you are implementing a by-law or an act that would rubbish it. The excuse some of them are giving that nigeria shut its borders is not valid because they already made this law; it’s not retaliation. Like (Moshood) Abiola would say, they should stop hiding behind one finger. They started the $300,000 proposition long ago and one of the reasons why I’m angry is that nigeria would never treat anybody like that, so why should they treat our people like that?I have Ghanaians working for me in nigeria and I have them in my house in Ghana. You want us to bring our money, but you don’t want our traders to come to your country and survive. Every part of London you go to today, you would find Nigerians trading. If they are asked to invest $1m, will they be able to do it? There are Ghanaian restaurants in the US and I have been to such in Atlanta, so if they are asked to invest $1m, will they be able to raise it? The answer is no. Let’s say the Nigerian government has said if Ghana insisted on the $1m levy, it would mean their people cannot come here too.I know many Ghanaian women that come here to trade in fabrics while some bring their Kente here and nobody stops them. If we also tell them to invest $1m before they can set up their business, how many things would they sell to raise the money? We don’t charge them a dime. There was a Ghanaian family in Agbara and the government of Ogun State was going to demolish their house for building their factory on an illegal site. I didn’t know them but they got my number and called me in Ghana. I called the governor on their behalf and the governor stopped the demolition. Nobody would do that for you in Ghana. They didn’t do it for me, though I didn’t mind because I’m a risk taker.The spokesperson for Ghana’s Trade Ministry said the affected traders were given one-year notice, perhaps the Nigerian traders could have drawn the attention of the government to it?It is not true, and that is why I said the ding dong has been there for so long. Even the $300,000, those traders can’t pay it. So, it is not the fault of the traders, it’s our government that has to take care of those things. Where would those traders have gone when the government is aware? The Minister of Foreign Affairs cannot take any unilateral decision without clearance from the President, and if the President does not approve, what would he do? I have always advised him (the President) in my articles that I do not expect him to know everything, but if you don’t know something, ask others who know it to do it for you. So, the problem is largely due to the fact that things are not working well, and like the saying goes, without a crack in the wall, lizards would not be able to enter.We have a presidency that has yet to wake up to its responsibilities in terms of foreign policy. When this thing happened, I sent messages to the relevant officials, but it was understandable that they were handicapped. I believe that if we don’t get the attention of the government, this thing would get out of hand. It got to a stage that I had to organise palliatives. I gave money to all the ones we could identify in Accra, about 111 of them because I knew that a number of such persons couldn’t feed their families without opening their shops. We’re not even talking about those in Kumasi. The money I gave to them was very small but it meant a lot to them and they were very happy. Till today, I have not seen others come up to say they want to help these people, not even the government. If it were other countries, they would have done something to help them.You said former President Kwame Nkrumah would be turning in his grave in anger seeing what is happening between nigeria and Ghana, does it mean the present crop of leaders in Ghana don’t have so much respect for nigeria or Nigerians?It is strange! I asked Femi Fani-Kayode this question a few nights ago during my interview with him because the current President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Ado, is supposed to be one of the closest to nigeria. His first wife who had two children with him was Femi’s sister, Remi. Now there is Lady Rebecca, who is the first lady and she’s very close to nigeria. She has loads of friends here. So, I expect that if no one would understand Nigerians, it shouldn’t be the President and his family. I even heard one of his daughters is married to a Nigerian. Then, a lot of Nigerians are married to Ghanaians, so, you wonder why we continue to fight despite our closeness.https://punchng.com/buharis-foreign-policy-weak-he-should-be-tougher-on-ghana-others-dele-momodu/"

1059,,,"Discordant Tunes in nigeria - Ghana RelationsBy Tom FredFishnigeria and Ghana has faced dramatic twists and turns in their diplomatic relations over the years. In an unsubtle manner the interactions between the two countries has oscillated between co-operation and mutual suspicion. A study of the relations between the two countries constitute an interesting research for both scholars of international relations and interested publics in the understanding of the dynamics of international relations. For now, the concern is that their interactions have defied the logic of simple prediction even when they have so many things in common. Both counties have similar backgrounds of interest. At independence, the challenge of African unity was at the front burner of their national discourse as they lived up to the challenge of helping other colonized countries to gain their political freedom. Historical, they are victims of exploitative and dehumanizing British colonialism and achieved a series of constitutional conferences.Economically, both countries were basically agricultural and dominated export of primary produce and the import of a wide range of manufactured goods and services from Europe and North America. They have been faced with similar economic problems of mass poverty, corruption and deprivation. Contemporaneously, both countries are in their Ninth Republic after recovering from battered democracies ochestrated by a series of military interventions. In sports, both countries have a long history of soccer rivarly.Notwithstanding the similar background of interests, both countries have shared discordant memories from 1960 to date. An attempt to overcome these challenges and strengthen their age-long socio-economic ties to energize and consolidate their relations led to the nigeria - Ghana Economic Summit in Accra in 2010 to enable the business community of both countries make input into the formulation of government policies to eliminate trade barriers. But it made no significant impact on their relations.The renewed hostilities between both countries has left International Relations experts calibrating on the reoccurring row. Could Ghana be flexing financial muscles with nigeria because of her budding economy, or are they taking swipe on nigeria's multifaceted and incubus challenges? Could it also be the discovery of large quantities oil wells in Ghana, which predicts Ghana to be an oil producing and exporting country like nigeria from 2020? nigeria's role as a major oil supplier and her rating as the biggest economy in Africa should occupy important position in this discourse.nigeria, through her Minister of Information and Culture, Chief Lai Mohammed has made a couple of accusations. They accused Ghana of seizing her Mission's property at 10 Barnes Road, Accra, as well as demolishing that of 19/21 Julius Nyerere Street, Accra; deporting of about 825 Nigerians under one year; placing huge Residency Permit Fees on Nigerians; waging media war against Nigerians in Ghana; harassing Nigerians in Ghana; closing down of Shops belonging to Nigerians; biased judicial trial and pronouncements of indiscriminate long jail terms for convicted Nigerians and outrageous stipulations and amendment of the GIPC Act.Ghana on her part denied all the allegations against her through her Minister of Information, Endkojo Oppong Nkrumah (MP) but noted that nigeria should not be the one complaining because she had taken steps that gravely affected other countries in the region including Ghana, in a bid to pursue her national interest. The Nigerian President, Mohammadu Buhari had through an executive order closed the Seme Krake border since August 2019 till date, hindering human and vehicular movements and enforcing policies aimed at preventing foreigners from getting jobs that Nigerians can do. Nigerians in Ghana disagrees with the Ghanaian Information Minister through the president of the Nigerian Traders Union in Ghana, Chukwuemeka Nnaji who informed NAN that the allegations against Ghana were true. To cement Mr. Nnaji's information, actions further taken by Ghanaians suggests in some quarters that Ghana's hostilities is because nigeria was the first to luanch a missile when it closed it's borders, harming Ghanian businesses.Two events can be adduced to this fact. First, a group ""Ghana The Black Star of Africa"" dedicated to highlighting the bright side of Ghana on social media, queried on their Facebook page why nigeria shut her border. In a post which generated over a thousand likes, they said: ""Have people asked why nigeria closed it’s border immediately Ghana won the bid to host the Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)? And they didn’t close all their borders but the western border, the one that borders Benin, Togo and Ghana. That’s the only border smuggling can take place, no other place, they claim. Ghanaians are known to be laidback, it’s almost un-Ghanaian to speak some of these facts but if some of these things remain unspoken, relationships cannot be mended. We hope one day, we will see ourselves as Africans than the boundaries carved for us by the colonialists,"" they quizzed. Second, is the statement made by Ghana's Foreign Minister, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, who said that nigeria's border closure in 2019 hurt Ghanaians and nearly bankrupted many: ""of course, this decision ended up hurting Ghanaian exporters and brought many of them to their knees financially as trucks were stuck at the Seme Krake border for months.""However, Some Nigerians do not believe that the closure of her border was the motivation for Ghana's latest hostilities. The opinion were expressed by Senator Musliu Obanikoro and Chief Dele Momodu in seperate interviews on Channels Television. Senator Musliu Obanikoro, a former High Commissioner to Ghana confirmed that he was not surprised that Ghana authorities often demand exorbitant amount as taxes from Nigerian traders - a practice he discouraged when he was serving in Ghana. On his part, Dele Momodu, a journalist, publisher and resident in Ghana for over a decade, said that Ghana's action is a long age political attitude and a calculated attempt at expunging Nigerians from the country.As the Speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabialamila sets the tune to fix the age long relationship with a two day visit to the  Parliament of Ghana, both counties should consider the strategic roles they play in West Africa and be conscious of the kind of domestic policies they make, as this thesis have proven that domestic policies of a country can have ripples affect on another. Ghana should be sincere in taking responsibility for the demolished Nigerian Mission, while making amends to complement each other should top priority in the new talks for coexistence. Ghana should dismantle or revisit the GIPC Law on Retail Trade in a bid to make it more humane, while appealing to the Nigerian authority to consider reopening her borders or profer alternative in air or water as big brother of the region.  They should work to strengthen their links with the existing diaporas for accurate information and their diplomatic missions should develop patience and understanding with one another. This thesis opined that both countries should as a matter of urgency open a Trade and Consultative Forum (TCF) under their Embassies, High Commission and Consulate to open discussions whenever policies that may affect their citizens or business interests are to be taken. They should also consider rendering courteous services, openness and prompt response to inquiries about government policies and programmes, timely and frequent communication and information dissemination should be activated by both countries. Whether they will leave their egos behind and think along these lines is a decision they must consider for the interest of Africa. But in all, the suggested keys are means to building an effective and positive relations between both West African countries and the African continent as a region.

1061,,," https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibyNEfAaro8Notwithstanding all efforts to promote local production of rice in the country, the protracted smuggling of the commodity appears to have grown to the extent of dominating the market, just as it suck away the foreign exchange by way of capital flight.Rice is actually the most preferred staple food for Nigerians, This make it so popular and ever sough for by Nigerians, young or old. Major markets across the country can never be short of rice. But the more worrisome aspect is that about 70 per cent of rice in the local market are foreign parboiled rice, while the locally made rice have been overwhelmed and barely has no place in the market.For these facts, rice continues to receive more attractions from core businessmen, manipulators and the smugglers. Indeed, the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) has adjudged rice as the most smuggled items through the land borders.The Guardian investigations showed that rice is the most profitable commodity for smugglers as there are always ready buyers for the smuggled rice. The consumers also claimed that the foreign products are cheaper and more available than the locally produced rice.During a visit to Seme border in Republic of Benin, it was discovered that the popular market in Seme was dominated by Nigerians who were buying rice in bags and smuggled them into nigeria through the unapproved routes. Same thing was discovered at Idiroko border and Ilaro in Ogun State. In fact, Nigerian currency (Naira) was freely traded with in the Seme market.The products are sometimes conveyed on motorcycle popularly known as Okada, carrying four to six bags at a go. They move it across the border with alleged 'settlement' of about N100 daily. The Guardian learnt that the Okada smugglers sometimes move in convoy with an escort who interface with the security agencies.Aside from the petty rice smugglers, truckloads of the commodity are always smuggled into the country, although, many are being confiscated by the Customs. Notwithstanding the numerous seizures, the smugglers appears non perturbed, as they move on top of their game, against all odds.Smuggling of foreign parboiled rice from across the borders (mainly Benin Republic) is posing threat to the rice industry in nigeria.For decades the Federal Government have been formulating policies on control of rice importation. In 2015 the government, through the Central Bank of nigeria (CBN) placed an outright ban on importation of rice from land borders, while it slammed 70 per cent duty on rice importation from the seaports, a measure it argued was to help conserve the nation's foreign reserves and encourage local production.Despite the government's high tariffs, that supply gap is still being plugged by imports. Even worse, some importers are avoiding the steep import tariffs and chose excessive profiteering by smuggling rice through porous land borders, not minding the inherent risks.The most terrible aspect is that the quality of the smuggled rice could not be guaranteed, thereby posing health challenges to the unsuspected citizens.In 2016, an alarm was raised on the shipping of fake rice also known as 'plastic rice' into the country from China. The Customs was immediately put on red alert and the situation was later curtailed. As if that was not enough, in 2017, The Federal Government also warned that there were some brands of poisonous foreign rice in circulation.Having critically examined the items, the Comptroller-General of Customs, Hameed Ali described rice imported into nigeria as poisonous, advising Nigerians to stop consuming it.He said: ""A chemical must have been added to sustain its freshness and that chemical is harmful. Also, it has been re-bagged with a new date given as the production and expiry date and that is what we consume here which causes diseases.""So, I appeal to Nigerians to please patronise our own rice; it is available, more nutritious and if you do that you will assist Customs by making sure these people are put out of business,"" Ali said during a press conference organised by the Ministry of Finance in Abuja.The Customs CG said the Federal Government had not issued license for importation of rice and that any rice seen on the streets that was not produced in nigeria was smuggled.Illegal rice importation, he said, remains one of the biggest challenges facing the nigeria Customs Service.Also, the Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri said: ""For imported rice, we don't know how long it had been in their (exporters) silos. Recently, one country decided to bring in a shipload of rice into nigeria so that we can use it to support the IDPs (Internationally Displaced Persons) in the North-East, but when we subjected the rice to a test, we discovered that the rice was actually poisonous.""This means that most imported rice have been in silos for 10 to 15 years and have no nutritional value. So what we have told them is that anybody who wants to support the IDPs or any other person in nigeria should please use our local rice.""The argument is that local rice is more expensive, but we say even if it means buying half bag, do it. It is better for us to eat a smaller quantity of nutritious rice than for us to take poisonous shiploads of rice,"" he said.Meanwhile, foreign rice has continued to litter Nigerian markets. From Sango market in Ota, Ogun State to Daleko market in Mushin; Mile 2 in Lagos; Utako Market, Abuja; Terminus Market Jos; Mile 3 Market Port-Harcourt; Main Market, Onitsha; Singer Market in Kano; Ogbete Market in Enugu, and Jimeta Main Market in Yola, among others, foreign parboiled rice are predominantly displayed and gained so much patronage.Checks revealed that many of these are smuggled rice. For example, The Guardian's investigation at Sango market showed that the smugglers came in as early as 4.00 am to offload the products to the rice dealers who usually buy as low as between N12,500 and 13,000 per 50 kg bag and resells at between N14,000 and 15,000 per bag.In a chart with The Guardian, as smuggler at Sango market said: ""rice trading"" is one of the best business he like doing, claiming that as risky as the business may look, he makes good returns.The young man, who identified himself as Taiwo Abe, said: ""I don't know why government will ask us not to import rice. We are into business, after all, we don't kill and we are not stealing. We make meaningful income from this business and that is what I use to sustain my family. I have wife and children that I also need to feed and I cannot do rituals, I can't do Internet fraud (yahoo yahoo). But, the business of smuggling pays. I am a carpenter, but no patronage, no sales, so I need to look for alternative means of survival, and rice smuggling has helped me a lot,""On the risk, he said: ""There is no business that is not risky. I am nurtured on the street and I was trained to hustle. I use unapproved routes where no Customs officer will disturb you. Besides, we have some contacts that guide our movement, so, to me it's not a big deal.""A saleswoman, who simply identified herself as Risikat, said it is cheaper to patronize smugglers than the local rice millers, adding that even the customers prefer foreign rice.""The only Nigerian rice that customers demand for is Ofada rice and I don't sell it. It is cheaper to buy from smugglers and I make more profit,""She berate a situation whereby the Customs raid their shops and seized their stocks last year, calling on the Federal Government to also create a conducive environment for businesses to thrive. She said the bad economy is forcing people to look for alternative means of survival.For the Nigerian Customs, it is an unending struggle. The officers are already overwhelmed with rice smuggling as they face reprisal attack and brutal retaliation on daily basis. For example, A Customs Assistant 1, Hamisu Sani, was killed in one of such encounter at Asero area of Abeokuta, Ogun State, while Tunde Wasiu Abdul'Azez was killed on Palace Road, Gumel Local Government Area of Jigawa State.However, the seizures continued. The stores are filled to the brim. But the smugglers are unrelenting. The battle continues.The nigeria Customs Service said it seized 497,279 bags of imported rice between 2015 and August, 2017 with a Duty Paid Value of N3.8 billion. The effort by customs notwithstanding, the figure only represents a fraction of smuggled rice into the country within the review period.In 2018, the Customs seized 238,094(50kg) bags of rice across the country from January to November. The bags of rice, according to the Public Relations Officer of Customs, Joseph Attah, worth N4.05 billion.In Ogun State Area command, about 44,615 bags of foreign rice were seized between the period, while the Area II Command, Onne, Rivers State confiscated 118 containers loaded with foreign rice. Seme Command seized 37,568 bags of 50kg foreign rice, which is equivalent to over 63 trailers of rice, with DPV of N876 million in 2018.In the first quarter 2019, the FOU Zone A intercepted 16,117 bags of 50kg parboiled rice; The Nigerian Navy, Forward Operating Base (FOB) in Akwa Ibom seized 2,044 bags of rice in one month (April).The Commanding Officer, Forward Operating Base (FOB), Ibaka, Captain Toritseju Vincent said: ""These anti-smuggling activities are inimical to the growth of our own rice industry. So we will continue to do our duty to make sure we nip it in bud, and bring it to a complete halt,""He said the commodity was brought in with a boat, while the suspects abandoned the boat and the products, the pumping machine and fled.Controller, Seme Command of Customs, Mohammed Uba Garba, who also berated the spate of rice smuggling into the country, said: ""Government allowed the importation of fertiliser duty free with the aim to boost agricultural production. You are also aware that government has engaged some individuals with a view to stimulating local production of rice. This comes with benefits such as employment generation, preservation of foreign exchange, and food security among others.""No nation can develop under hunger. People can se0ek advice on proposed ideas when they are properly fed. It is along this line that we are so much committed against the smuggling of foreign rice. Part of the danger of foreign rice is that it would deplete our foreign exchange. Besides, nobody knows the duration of when the rice was produced, but people will buy and consume it. It is hazardous to health,"" he stated.Controller Federal Operation Unit (FOU) Zone A, Aliyu Mohammed, said: ""Nobody will grow our economy for us, we must work together to make nigeria great. If you go to Cotonou now, over N1 trillion bags of rice are waiting there and they must enter nigeria. How many officers are in Customs? With all our efforts, some of them will find their way. We can't eradicate it completely because of the nation's porous borders. Besides, we don't have friends; people are always working against us. If you go out now and see them beating a Customs officer, you will join them to beat him. It is unfortunate. The smugglers are seeing it as their birthright to smuggle. They claimed they couldn't go to school and start looking for job after graduation, so they are looking for quick means of making money"".He alleged that the act of smuggling are perpetrated by the rich men, who see it as a booming business, saying, ""A poor man can not use the small money he has to buy rice, but a rich man will buy it and use the poor man to smuggle it. They are using innocent people to enrich themselves. We should all work to support government policies. Go to Benin Republic, visit the round about area, you will discover that prices of houses have soar, because they have turned most of their residential buildings to warehouses where they keep rice and earn higher income. So, they get more money for keeping rice than rent it as residential"".He also emphasized the quality of local rice and its health benefits, saying: ""Go and get the foreign rice and cook it. If you are a Hausa man, I will tell you to make Tuwo shinkafa. Then, get Kebbi or Abakaliki rice and make the same Tuwo shinkafa. Cover it throughout the day and open it in the morning. You will discover that the foreign rice will scatter because it is chemical rice, but our local rice will be intact and the aroma will be enticing. Then, you will never eat foreign rice again.""Those who are saying that the local rice is not enough are the real smugglers because they don't want you to know the secrete. Go to Bida, Abakaliki, Adija, you will see the large expanse of land used in harvesting rice. We need to help our leaders. We need to help this country,"" he said.Against the backdrop of the Nigerian government's policy on domestication of the rice industry and the war against its illegal importation, seaports of West African countries are still receiving large quantities of the commodity, apparently for onward shipment to nigeria through the land borders. Consequently the commodity still tops the smuggling chart and seized items by the recent records of the nigeria Customs Service, while poultry products and vehicles occupies the second and third highest smuggled items into the country.According to Economic Confidential, in a three-week survey on the rice market across the six geopolitical zones in the country, Economic Confidential team observed that foreign rice such as Mama Gold, Royal Stallion, Rice Master, Caprice, Falcon Rice and Basmati are sold alongside Nigerian rice namely: Umza and Fursa Crown from Kano, Mama Happy from Niger, Labana Rice from Kebbi, Olam Rice from Nasarawa, Abakaliki Rice from Ebonyi, Ofada Rice from Ogun State, Swomen Dama from Plateau, Lake Rice of Lagos/Kebbi States among others.National Deputy President, Rice Farmers Association of nigeria, Segun Atho, told The Guardian that smuggling is a major threat to rice production in the country, but all hands are on deck to ensure that the nation feeds itself through sustainable local production of rice.""Rice smuggling is another virus in the content of nigeria, because if you look at the rate people smuggle rice, it is alarming. There are some cartels behind it that are not ready to sheath their swords. Rice is being produced by almost every nation and it has become a staple food, which is important to every nation that wants to survive.""When we complain about smugglers, what about the Customs that are support to prevent them? They are there when the women are carrying small bags containing rice into the country. They are there when some people are using bad vehicles to convey smuggled goods. They are there what are they looking at? Although, some the Customs officers are good while they still have some bad elements among them. They will collect money from the smugglers and allow them to go.""Also, the border communities see smuggling as their national cake and this is unfortunate. It is a serious situation. We have to fight together, if nigeria want to attain self sufficiency and sustainability in rice production.""Farmers are doing their best, and I can see that smuggling is reducing because right away, I am talking from the farm. All over the country, farmers are producing and we are trying to mop up the production for processing and for marketing and all hands are on deck.He said the Anchor Borrowers Programme introduced by the Federal Government has helped farmers a lot.Denying the claims that foreign rice is more than local rice in the market, Atho said: That is not true. What we have is that some rice sellers re-bag local products into foreign sacks and sell as imported rice. This is because of the consumption pattern of Nigerians and we really need to change that. We need to patronize locally made goods. Do you know that they are packing Nigerian rice in foreign bags? Because they know that the consumers cherished it. You have been eating Nigerian rice but you don't know. Go to the integrated rice mills in Kano, Kebbi, Wakot, Benue, Abakaliki. Coscharis, Dangote, Sam Egu are all bagging rice now.The Rice Processors Association of nigeria (RIPAN) had earlier raised an alarm that over one million metric tons of rice has been smuggled into nigeria in the last three months.The Chairman of RIPAN, Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar Maifata made this revelation in Abuja, said: ""Investors in nigeria have made enormous financial commitment in the Rice Sub-sector. Unfortunately, the only threat to the industry's total development, is Smuggling.Over one million metric tons of Rice which is equivalent to about 20,000,000 bags of 50kg rice have been smuggled into nigeria in the last three months.""nigeria currently loses huge revenues, foreign exchange and Jobs to this menace as nigeria Rice Processing companies are shutting down because of their inability to gain market access.""More painfully millions of small-holder Farmers are stuck with their Paddy because the Millers can no longer afford to buy from them.""He said investigations conducted by the Association in the last few months indicated that, ""all our international borders have been converted to smugglers route and our markets are filled with smuggled foreign rice"".He cautioned that, ""there is the need for urgent actions to avert eventual national food emergency by combating smuggling so that we can continue to grow our local Rice industry and the economy"".https://allafrica.com/stories/201905290464.html"

Everyone can't be hard working and those that have money can't be told how to use their money. This is a real world.One of the reasons I supported PMB was cause he said he'll assemble a team of competent hands to help run the country when elected- something I felt the previous administration lacked. But alas, every post is still occupied by politicians making decisions to suit their political interests. Seriously, it's frustrating."

Eventually, import will cease but who farms today? Do you have a crop farm? There is no local government in nigeria today where herdsmen have not gone to turn people's crops into cow feed. If the herdsmen issue is not settled, nobody will seriously invest in farming especially the vulnerable crops of rice and maize. There is also another problem of Nigerians preferring foreign products to locally made, the greed of middlemen. The wickedness of the average Nigerian. We keep saying we want this country to be self sufficient, do top policy makers and politicians patronise made in nigeria? Do they put themselves in a position where their bad policies affect them directly? In case you do not know, there is a very high chance that once or twice every month, a presidential jet is sent to london to shop for what the first family eats and that sort of habit trickles down from top to bottom. nigeria has fundamental issues, the educational system is where the correction should start and we won't see results for at least 10 years but unfortunately nothing is being done. All politicians think about is getting into office to steal and pretend as if they are governing. Look at Buhari, the man has borrowed more in 5 years than all the governments since 1999 to consume, not even to invest, excess crude account is gone. Nothing to show. Now the price of fuel has gone up and will continue going up as crude oil price increases. So also will food stuff, the last inflation rate for food stuff was 15%, by year ending inflation will be close to 50% total. It is a curse to be born Nigerian.

Nkrumah accused Nigerian traders in Ghana of gross violations of retail trade laws, including tax evasion, immigration offences, and selling substandard products.Nkrumah stated this in reaction to a statement by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, that the Federal Government would no longer condone the reported harassment of Nigerians in the former Gold Coast.Mohammed had in his statement on Friday listed various acts of aggression against nigeria and its citizens by the Ghanaian authorities, including the takeover of some Nigerian diplomatic properties, discriminatory deportation of 825 Nigerians within one year and harsh jail sentences on Nigerians.But Nkrumah said contrary to Mohammed’s claims that 825 Nigerians were deported between January 2018 and February 2019, only 700 Nigerians involved in fraud, prostitution, and armed robbery were deported from Ghana.Nkrumah stated, “The Federal Republic (nigeria), on the other hand, is on record to have taken a number of steps in recent months, in pursuit of her national interests, which have gravely affected other countries in the region.“These include the closure of nigeria’s Seme-Krake border from August 2019 to date and the issuance of executive orders by nigeria’s Presidency preventing foreigners from getting jobs which Nigerians can do, to mention a few.”The minister assured that the Ghanaian President, Nana Akufo-Addo, would engage with nigeria’s President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and develop a framework for validating the claims of ill-treatment of citizens of either country and ensure they enjoy the full exercise of their rights while respecting the sovereignty and laws of both countries.Nkrumah said his counterpart’s assertion on the alleged seizure of Nigerian Mission property located at No. 10, Barnes Road, Accra, was incorrect, noting that the land was acquired by nigeria from a private citizen, Thomas Hardy, on October 23, 1959.The minister explained that the commercial lease on the land expired 46 years ago without any evidence of renewal by the Nigerian High Commission in Ghana.On the high residency permit levies, including the $120 for COVID-19 test imposed by the authorities, Nkrumah stated that this applied to all foreigners and not just Nigerians.Speaking on the closure of over 1,000 shops belonging to Nigerians over non-payment of the $1m trade levy, the information minister stated, “The compliance exercises conducted in the selected markets revealed gross violations of retail trade laws and regulations by Ghanaians and foreigners, including Nigerians.“These violations included tax evasion, immigration offences, trading in substandard products, violation of the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre law, improper registration of firms, under-payment of business operating permits, falsification of documents, among others.”Meanwhile, the Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, on Sunday condemned Ghana’s hostile policies targeted mainly at Nigerian.In separate letters to Buhari; Foreign Affairs Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama and Lai Mohammed, Obiano said Ghana was not being fair to Nigerians, given the major role that the late Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, played “in reshaping the history and destiny of Ghana.”In one of the letters made available to our correspondent in Awka, the Anambra State by the state Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, C-Don Adinuba, Obiano said, “After all, it was the Great Zik of Africa (Nnamdi Azikiwe) who, as Editor-in-Chief of The African Morning Post in Accra in the 1940s, discovered the promising and intelligent young man known as Kwame Nkrumah and encouraged him to travel to the United States for further education and even secured admission for the young man in Zik’s alma mater, Storer College in Philadelphia.“The Anambra State government notes that it will be a profoundly sad development if Ghanaians create the impression that non-Africans are welcome to their country but not fellow blacks and Africans.”Source: https://punchng.com/700-nigerians-involved-in-fraud-prostitution-robbery-deported-ghana/"

The Government ofGhana was not involved in the transaction and has not seized the property inquestion.2(II) Accusation:Also, even though the main reason given for the seizure of Federal Governmentproperty at No. 10 Barnes Road in Accra is the non-renewal of Lease afterexpiration, the Ghanaian authority did not give nigeria the right of first refusalor the notice to renew the Lease. By contrast, the lease on some of the propertiesoccupied by the Ghanaian Mission in nigeria has long expired, yetsuch properties have not been seized.Response: The Government of Ghana does not, did not and never owned theland, and has not been involved in the seizure of any property of the NigerianHigh Commission in Ghana. The land in question is owned by the Osu Stooland managed by the Lands Commission.In response to the claim that the lease on some of the properties owned by theGhana Mission in nigeria has long expired, it must be noted thatthe Government acquired a freehold land at Pope John Paul II Street inAbuja in 1989 through a commercial arrangement, and built the currentstructures on it. The staff of the Ghana High Commission in Abuja have beenliving there since the construction of the current structures.(III) Accusation:Demolition of the Nigerian Mission’s property located at No. 19/21Julius Nyerere Street, East Ridge, Accra, which constitutes another serious breach ofthe Vienna Convention.Response:This statement is not factual. A search at the Lands Commission indicated thatthe Nigerian High Commission failed to complete the documentation processafter paying for the land in the year 2000 A.D. The High Commission failed toacquire the Lease and Land Title Certificate, which constitute documentationfor the said property, as well as a building permit for construction. In Ghana,land is owned not only by the Government, but also by Stools and Families.The demolition of the property was not carried out by agents of the GhanaianGovernment, but by agents of the Osu Stool. Nonetheless, the Government ofGhana, valuing the relations between our two countries, has decided to restorethe property, at its own cost, to its original state for the Nigerian HighCommission, and has duly communicated same to the Nigerian Authorities. TheGovernment of Ghana has also agreed to facilitate the proper acquisition of titleby the Nigerian High Commission, as announced by Ghana’s Minister forForegin Affairs at the time of the incident.3(IV) Accusation:Aggressive and incessant deportation of Nigerians from Ghana. BetweenJanuary 2018 and February 2019, Eight Hundred and Twenty-Five(825) Nigerians were deported from Ghana.Response:This statement is not factual. In 2019, seven hundred (700) Nigerians, who werefound to have been involved in criminal activities such as fraud, prostitution,armed robbery etc., were deported.(V) Accusation:Residency permit requirement, for which Ghana Immigration Service has placedhuge fees far higher than the fees charged by the Nigerian Immigration Service.These include the compulsory non- citizen ID card (US$120, US$ 60 for yearlyrenewal); medical examinations, including for COVID-19 which is newlyintroduced (about US$ 120), and payment for residency permit (US$ 400compared to the N700,000 being paid by Ghanaians for residency card innigeria).Response:It must be noted that all foreigners, who apply for resident permit in Ghana,pay same fees as stated above. These fees are not specific to Nigerians.(VI) Accusation:“Media war against Nigerians in Ghana. The negative reportage of issuesconcerning Nigerians resident in Ghana by the Ghanaian media is fuelling anemerging xenophobic attitude against Nigerian traders and Nigerians in general.The immediate fallout is the incessant harassment and arrest of Nigerian tradersand closure of their shops.”Response:The statement is not factual. There is no media war against Nigerians in Ghana.There is also no negative reportage on Nigerian residents in Ghana by Ghanaianmedia, which could potentially lead to xenophobic attitude towards Nigerians,particularly Nigerian traders in Ghana.No Nigerian trader has been arrested. The closure of shops was as a result ofinfractions on Ghanaian laws. Even then, those affected who are not onlyNigerians, have been given ample time to regularise theirdocuments. Furthermore, no Nigerian- owned shops are currently closed.4On the contrary, the negative reportage has been against the GhanaianGovernment from high places, (tweets by Foreign Minister of nigeria and aNigerian businessman, who appears to have political interests in Ghana), innigeria. This is inconsistent with established practice in our very goodrelations. The Press Release by the Information and Culture Minister of nigeriais a clear departure from the manner in which officials of the two countries haverelated with each other in the past.(VII) Accusation:“nigeria has time after time demonstrated its fidelity to the long cordial relationswith Ghana. But indications especially in recent times, are that nigeria’s stanceis now being taken for granted and its citizens being made targets of harassmentand objects of ridicule. This will no longer be tolerated under any guise.”Response: Ghana has always demonstrated her commitment to excellentrelations with nigeria which is evidenced by the manner in whichGhanaian Government officials dealt with recent issues, which have had severeeconomic impact on our country.Ghana did not resort to any media war. However, the Ghanaian Ministers ofForeign Affairs and Trade travelled to Abuja to try to resolve diplomatically theissue of closure of Nigerian borders, and to seek safe corridor for ECOWASTrade Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS) exports from Ghana, all to no avail. It isexpected that the response of Nigerian Authorities to situations that evolve inour relations should be guided by the merits of the matter and our mutualinterests.(VIII) Accusation:That three hundred (300), six hundred (600) and two hundred and fifty (250)shops belonging to Nigerians were closed down in 2018, 2019 and 2020respectivelyResponse:Upon evidence that some individuals, including Ghanaians and non-Ghanaians,had been involved in various forms of trade, without complying with the lawsand regulations of Ghana, several engagements and prior advice had been givento encourage compliance.Ghana’s Minister for Trade and Industry personally intervened to ensure thereopening of closed shops, pending compliance with Ghana’s laws by theiroperators. 5Among other corrective measures, the Committee on Foreigners in RetailTrade, comprising representatives of various regulatory agencies and institutionsin Ghana, was tasked with the responsibility of conducting inspections of retailshops in designated commercial districts in both Accra and Kumasi to ensurecompliance with retail trade laws and regulations.The compliance exercises conducted in the selected markets revealed grossviolations of retail trade laws and regulations by Ghanaians and foreigners,including Nigerians. These violations included tax evasion, immigrationoffenses, trading in sub-standard products, violation of the Ghana InvestmentPromotion Centre (GIPC) law, improper registration of firms, under-paymentof business operating permits, falsification of documents, among others.In all cases, non-compliant shop owners are given adequate notice to regularizetheir documents, before action is taken to close any shop/business.It is an incontestable fact that there is widespread abuse and disregard for locallaws and regulations governing retail trade by some foreigners, includingNigerians, which need to be addressed without discrimination. It is importantto note that the compliance exercise under reference is not restricted to eitherECOWAS nationals or Nigerians for that matter, but extend to all individualsengaged in retail trade, including Ghanaians.(IX) Accusation:Harsh and openly biased judicial trial and pronouncements of indiscriminatelylong jail terms for convicted Nigerians.Response:Ghana’s courts, at all material times, function independently, and with strictrespect for the Laws of Ghana, regardless of the nationalities of accusedpersons. Judges neither convict nor sentence with a bias for or againstnationalities. Nigerians and Ghanaians convicted for same offenses are nottreated differently.(X) Accusation:Outrageous stipulations and amendments of the GIPC Act.Response:It is untrue that the law has been amended twice, and, accordingly, there is no2018 GIPC Act. Further, the statement that a review of the Act has increasedthe minimum capital base for foreign owned businesses to US$1.00m is false.Perhaps the reference is to sections 27 (2 & 3) of the GIPC Act and relate solelyto persons who are not citizens but want to engage in retail trade or tradingactivities, which are otherwise restricted exclusively to Ghanaians. Accordingly, 6‘a person who is not a citizen may engage in a trading Enterprise if that personinvests in the Enterprise, not less than One Million United States Dollars in cashor goods and services relevant to the investments. Trading includes purchasingand selling of imported goods and services. The amount does not relate to thebroad universe of investors. We are also somewhat astonished to have the lawsof a sovereign nation described as outrageous, especially since they have notattracted the rebuff or criticism of any regional organization, especiallyECOWAS.The Federal Republic, on the other hand, is on record to have taken a number of steps inrecent months, in pursuit of her national interests, which have gravely affected othercountries in the Region. These include the closure of nigeria’s Seme Krake border fromAugust 2019 to date and the issuance of executive orders by nigeria’s Presidency,preventing foreigners from getting jobs which Nigerians can do, to mention a few. Ghanaand other West African countries continue to believe redress to even actions like these canbe sought, diplomatically, without resort to media statements and related activities thathave the potential to aggravate further the situation.The aforementioned notwithstanding, the President of the Republic of Ghana, H.E. NanaAddo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, who values very much his excellent relations with thePresident of the Federal Republic of nigeria, His Excellency Muhammadou Buhari, willengage President Buhari with a view to develop immediately a framework for validatingclaims of ill treatment of citizens of either country, and ensure citizens enjoy the fullexercise of their rights, while respecting the sovereignty and laws of both countries. Ghanaand nigeria, as they have been doing, must continue to work together for a successful WestAfrica.-ENDKOJO OPPONG NKRUMAH (MP)MINISTER"

This is with a view to discover the missing link, where and when we got it all wrong – Water, Education, Power, Agriculture, Health, Manufacturing, National Institutions. When was the last time you watched a Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) Programme, was there any noticeable improvement from what you have known it to be? Did nigeria ever show the promise of a great nation? As an optimist, I sometimes struggle to see how the nigeria of my dreams will be birthed. The late erudite Professor, Pius Adesanmi once wrote that the reason why he published articles on the Nigerian state was for Archeology purposes, to show that not all Nigerians looked away when her leaders showed no vision and sailed with the wind. It is the same with this article, it is to register my displeasure on how our Nation is being run.The reality of the Nigerian state is best described as a Nightmare. How did we end up being represented by ill-equipped and self-serving individuals? To use the current leadership as an example, how did a supposed Integrity hero manage to head a government whose legacies reek of corruption and corrupt practices? How did successive generations manage to sow discord and hate in their young? A visit to the politics thread on Nairaland (nigeria's most visited online forum) reveals the deep hatred the Igbos and the Yorubas have for one another. For how long will nigeria remain a bad dream? The realities of Covid-19 forced our leaders to have a taste of their evil deeds; some of them did not survive the border closure. Ironically, the typical Nigerian politician will not learn any lesson from the COVID experience. They are waiting for COVID to pass and get back to their normal way of life. A letter recently credited to the First Lady, after her return from a medical-related trip confirms this position.If the Nigerian story was a movie, the scriptwriter would have won multiple awards for documenting a brilliant horror story and the actors recognized for a flawless show of evil, ruthlessness and terror – with exception to a few actors.The Major political parties are structured to present undesirable candidates for elective positions, leaving the electorate a hard job of choosing between the devil and the deep blue sea. Our electoral laws and set up makes it difficult for private candidates to have any chance at the polls. For a long time, our education system remains on life support. This is not for a lack of Educational Policies, but a lack of implementation and leadership. The realities of COVID-19 underscore the importance of ICT Infrastructure to support blended learning. These infrastructures are non-existent in our tertiary institutions, needless to say in the public Secondary and Primary institutions. Undoubtedly, we need a revolution to birth the nigeria of our dreams. Be part of this revolution by being a good leader and citizen in whatever position you find yourself. Do not abuse your office; use your influence for the common good. Lead from the front; be accountable and transparent in your dealings. More importantly, a critical mass of the Nigerian Stakeholders must come together to set up mechanisms to engage and hold our leaders to account across board – at the Local, State and Federal levels.The tragedy of the Nigerian nation is one of leadership, men and women best described as mediocre with no moral pedigree continue to dominate and dictate how our nation is run. Their strategy is simple but it continues to work, to ride on the people and divide them along the fault lines of ethnicity and religion whilst plundering our national and collective wealth. nigeria has been a bad dream and Nightmare.Please, Wake me up.

It's still planting season. We have to wait till harvesting season before we can get reasonable prices.

1193,,,"Towards Dismantling of Petroleum Subsidy BY ALEX OTTI (OUTSIDE THE BOX)“Government Subsidy systems promote inefficiency in production and efficiency in coercion and subservience while penalizing efficiency in production and inefficiency in predation” Murray Rothbard (1926-1995)“You either get free stuff or you get freedom. You cannot have both and you need to make a choice.” – Sarah PalinSometime ago, the former Managing Director of the nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the Late Mr. Maikanti Baru, (may his soul rest in peace), revealed to Nigerians that a detailed study conducted by the NNPC established a strong correlation between the presence of fuel stations located around nigeria’s borders and the activities of fuel smuggling syndicates. Providing a detailed presentation of the findings, the then NNPC boss had disclosed that 16 states, having among them 61 local government areas with border communities, account for 2,201 of the nation’s registered fuel stations. He then noted that based on the number of all stations registered in the country, the fuel tank of the petrol stations, had a combined capacity of 144.998 million litres of petrol, representing about four times nigeria’s average daily fuel consumption of 35 million litres!The Late Mr. Baru had explained that because of the obvious differential in petrol prices between nigeria and other neighbouring countries, it had become lucrative for the smugglers to use the frontier stations as a veritable conduit for the smuggling of products across the border, adding that this had resulted in a thriving market for Nigerian petrol in all the neighbouring countries of Niger Republic, Benin Republic, Cameroun, Chad and Togo and even down to Ghana, which has no direct borders with nigeria.This now brings us to the first quote above, which incidentally, was used in the concluding part of our column on this same subject of subsidies on September 24, 2018. That piece was titled “Subsidies: Working the Monkey and Feeding the Baboon”. We had argued then that there was everything wrong about sustaining the subsidy on petroleum products and that it should therefore be removed immediately and permanently. We noted that the feeble attempt to remove it by not providing for it in the previous year’s budget met with colossal failure because the NNPC, at that time, decided to retain it by taking the funds from source, christening the expenditure, “Under Recovery”. It was thus expensed directly from NNPC’s books before remitting what was left to the Federation Account. We maintained in our article then, that the common man, who was supposed to be the greatest beneficiary of any such subsidy, was in fact the greatest loser.It is sad that literally almost overnight, Nigerians saw their ‘daily consumption’ of premium motor spirit, PMS, double from about 30m to 35m litres then to 60 million litres. Like we stated in the column under reference, the Late Mr. Maikanti Baru had raised an alarm on the proliferation of fuel stations in communities with international land and coastal borders across the country, insisting that the development had energised unprecedented cross-border smuggling of petrol to neighbouring countries, thus making it difficult to sanitise the fuel supply and distribution matrix in the country.One would have expected that with the announced closure of our land borders last year, the daily consumption would have returned to normal levels, but that is yet to be. Even as we write, we have not been able to push the number down as the official daily consumption figure as at last week, was still put at about 56m litres. It is therefore clear that there must be some other factors involved that have not been addressed.With the advent of the Coronavirus pandemic, oil prices dramatically hit rock bottom levels. The Federal Government used the opportunity to announce the complete removal of oil subsidy. According to Mallam Mele Kyari, the current Group Managing Director of NNPC, nigeria would no longer be paying for “Under Recovery” or subsidy on petroleum products. According to him “there is no subsidy and it is zero forever, going forward, there will be no resort to either subsidy or under recovery of any nature”. NNPC, he went on, will play in the marketplace, it will just be another marketer in the space. But we will be there for the country to sustain the security of supply at the marketplace. To give effect to the removal of subsidy, the 2020 budget, which had earlier made a provision of N457b for subsidy in the reviewed version, had this figure completely removed. Effectively this meant that there is no budget for the payment of subsidy in 2020. So far, all the signals appear that the government is serious about removing petroleum subsidy.In reality however, there is a whole lot more that needs to be done to ensure that this policy is successfully implemented. Like we noted earlier, this is not the first time that the government had threatened or attempted to remove petroleum subsidy. An attempt to do so in 2012 was greeted with stiff resistance from civil society, in a coordinated protest that almost brought down the government of the day. The current administration had also attempted to do so by not budgeting for it in 2017, but eventually found an ingenious way of not implementing it through the sleight of hand of the NNPC. Now that we have NNPC’s commitment that it is no longer going to fund this subsidy, there are some institutional changes that must be made to ensure that we never go back again to the era of petroleum subsidy.This column is of the opinion that the only way to ensure that this new stance on petroleum subsidy is successful is to dismantle the various institutions that have been established to implement it. For instance, there is this body called the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) founded in 2003 whose job is, among other responsibilities, to monitor and regulate the supply and distribution, and determine the prices of petroleum products. The PPPRA basically sets prices of petroleum products using a template designed by the agency to determine maximum prices of products. One would have expected that in a deregulated market, the PPPRA would no longer have any role to play or at the minimum, would have no hand in the determination of the prices of petroleum products. However, this is not yet the case as this body remains fully functional and continues to actively influence prices of petroleum products. Even if it is no longer publicly announcing its presence, it still remains active in the background, fixing prices. According to the most recent template sighted by us, the PPPRA sets the cost of crude in dollars. Freight Rate, Lightering Expenses, Insurance, NPA and NIMASA charges, (which are also set in dollars), Jetty Throughput, Storage Charges, Financing Cost, all amounting to a total landing cost. In addition to these is a plethora of other costs ,which to all intents and purposes, are avoidable and unjustifiably lead to higher cost of products as they are eventually passed on to final consumers. The PPPRA calls these costs, Distribution margins and they are as follows:1. Admin Charge N1.232. National Transporters Allowance (NTA). N3.893. Bridging Fund N7.514. Marine Transport Allowance. N0.155. Retailer. N6.19A cursory look at the above pricing model immediately shows that there is something fundamentally wrong with the system.First, we are benchmarking crude prices in dollars because the refined products are imported. However, the crude is locally produced and if locally refined, the prices would obviously have been different and more sensitive to the naira economy we operate locally. Again, what is the justification for NPA and NIMASA levies to be charged and collected in dollars? At what rate do the marketers source the dollars used for the payment?Secondly, what is the justification for the distribution margins itemised 1 to 4 above? More particularly, what is the reason for having No 3 – bridging fund? We are aware that the bridging fund has its basis from a strange invention called the Petroleum Equalisation Fund, (PEF). The logic, from the framers of the concept, is that it is intended to maintain the same price for petroleum products across the entire country. Time has shown that this is neither desirable nor feasible. There has never been a time where petroleum products sold for the same price in different parts of the country. Therefore, why maintain such an obsolete policy and add an unjustifiable extra N7.51 per litre to the price of PMS, which is also borne by the final consumer? How come we do not also have an equalisation fund for other products like yam, rice tomatoes, or even coke? What is so special about petrol that we insist that it must sell at the same price in every part of the country? When you add up the administrative charges, the transport allowances and the Bridge fund, you would realise that the PPPRA, as a bureaucracy, is hiking the price of petrol by a whopping N12.78 per litre. This translates to a humongous N716 billion a day for the 56 million barrels we are meant to be consuming. Another question also then, is this; what are PPPRA and PEF doing with this money?Furthermore, there is the issue of foreign exchange management and conservation. While we want to believe that petroleum subsidy has been removed, there seems to be another policy reintroducing the subsidy from the angle of the foreign exchange market. One may ask how this is done and it is as follows: From the number posted above, the pricing is benchmarked against an exchange rate of N387.63 per dollar. Does that rate exist in the market? Of course, we all know that this is the official rate enjoyed by NNPC and it is easy to understand as the company is the one that funds a chunk of the foreign exchange market. The net result of all these is that no one imports PMS except the Pipeline and Product Marketing Company, PPMC, which itself is a subsidiary of the NNPC. Independent marketers cannot access the N387 dollar and if they went ahead to import with dollars from the free market, they would not be able to compete with PPMC. In effect every petroleum products marketer is forced to buy from the government. This clearly is not a sustainable way to deregulate. In fact, this is a clear case of the government introducing monopoly from the black door!We all agree that local refinery would take off the cost of freight and some of the logistic costs highlighted above. We also know that the four refineries we have in the country have since become moribund, producing at less than one fifth of their capacity. We are also aware of the Dangote refinery, which when completed, will dwarf the combined 445,000 barrels per day capacity of our 4 refineries. Dangote’s greenfield refinery will have an installed capacity of 650,000 barrels per day. How would the untidy arrangement in place now affect that massive investment? We hear government is trying to invest in refurbishing the four refineries. Does anyone need to be told that that is not the most efficient way to spend our har earned money? We read reports recently that one of the refineries generated zero revenue in 2018 but incurred an operating loss of N64.5b and a wage bill of N23b for the year. The case is not any different with the other three refineries, which individually also posted losses.In view of the foregoing, our recommendation is that the government should dispose of the four refineries, even as scrap without further delay. It should also dismantle the PPPRA and PEF with immediate effect. PPPMC should stop importing PMS just like it had stopped importing Automotive Gas Oil. It should cede that role to the private sector immediately. The determination of prices should be left to the normal market forces of demand and supply. Importers should source their funds from the foreign exchange market just like other importers. They must bring in their products and sell in the open market without these artificial hurdles and obstacles. The relevant arm of the NNPC should play its role as a regulator in the market enforcing quality and interplay of market forces.Maximum encouragement should be given to entrepreneurs like Dangote and others to invest in the sector and get them to start refining in country in the shortest time possible. This is to reduce all the distortions that we presently face because of importation and all artificial constraints that have been built into it. On no account should we accept the ludicrous argument that there is a product that we can legislate a uniform price across the country. There is no such thing and whenever we do, we only help make undeserved money for some people while the purpose would not be achieved. We must begin to accept the well tested principle that the best mechanism to allocate resources is the market forces. Intervention from time to time would ensure that the market continues to work for the greater majority of the populace. It is in this light that we may need to take a second look at this behemoth called the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. Well, that is a story for another day."

1195,,,"In five-year free fall• CBN sells pound above N500 for the first timeThe naira has fallen by 108 per cent against the West African CFA (popularly known as CFA) in the past five years as the latter rallies to wipe out the hitherto wide trading gap between the two currencies.CFA, which is used by eight former West African colonies – Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo – exchanged for 33k on August 21, 2015, exactly five years ago.According to data sourced from the Central Bank of nigeria (CBN), it gained 36 kobo from August 19, 2015 to close at 0.6888 CFA/N1 on the CBN rate last week. This translates to a 108-per cent loss for the struggling naira.Further analysis shows that the naira, unlike the past five years, held firmer against the now-aggressive CFA in the first half of the decade reviewed. The naira closed at approximately 29 kobo for one CFA on August 21, 2010. It maintained its market dominance until 2013, when it started a gradual easing.It was not until 2015 when CFA began to take a spot as a competitive currency and started an aggressive rally that would remarkably close the previous wide differential between the two currencies. Between August 2015 and August 2016, the naira lost about 69 percent against CFA year-on-year.Within 12 months, the naira lost about 23 kobo to CFA, a currency that symbolises French economic imprint on the West Africa sub-region. The currency has recorded a similar leap in its value appreciation against the naira year-to-date, climbing from 0.5228/N1 it opened the year with to 0.6888 /N1 (translating to 32 percent) at the close of last week’s trading.The imperialist currency traded for about 15 kobo at the turn of this millennium. Until the West Africa trade corridor opened for unprecedented smuggling, not many Nigerians knew much about the currency, which is currently being considered for a replacement with Eco, the proposed West Africa regional legal tender.CFA’s current resurgence is coming on the heels of the continued closure of the country’s border against neighbouring West African countries, especially the Republic of Benin, where Nigerians engage in unrestrained trade.A WEAKENING exchange rate against CFA means it is cheaper for citizens of the eight neighbouring countries to import from nigeria and it is more expensive for Nigerian traders to do business in those countries.But while the cost of importing from those countries is on the increase with an average Nigerian household feeling the pains, the country does not seem to gain much in terms of export injections into Benin, Togo and others in the category.The West Africa region, for instance, accounted for just 11.5 percent of the country’s total export value in 2019, which the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) put at N19.2 trillion. nigeria was not also among Beninoise top 10 import sources last year. The only two of Africa’s countries that made the list dominated by Europe and Asia were Togo, its neighbour, and Morocco.Benin, topmost nigeria’s smuggling source, procured 13.6 percent and 11 percent of its last year imports from India and China respectively. Much of the imported goods were passed on to nigeria through the porous borders – a trade practice many experts have blamed for the country’s troubled real sector.THE Federal Government, last year, closed the country’s land borders against Benin, Chad and Niger as a major strategy to battle insecurity and dumping – twin challenges that have stunted growth in recent times.Unofficial trade between nigeria and Benin is a major factor deciding the country (nigeria)’s food price inflation. The price of rice experienced a spark last year, few weeks after the government announced the border closure. The price has thus increased by around 100 percent in the past year.ALSO last week, the CBN sold the pound above N500, as naira continues to battle major headwinds. For the first time, the CBN on Wednesday sold a pound for N501.98 and quoted N500.659 as its buying rate. At the parallel market, the currency is going for as much as N600. With the official rate hitting and surpassing N500 before the naira gained a momentary respite on Thursday, a new yardstick may have been set at the foreign exchange marketThe naira has faced daunting challenges since the beginning of the year. The apex bank’s plan to converge the rates has faced serious scrutiny.Bismarck Rewane, a member of President Muhammadu Buhari’s Economic Advisory Council, said unification is a tough policy option the Central Bank would need to make.

1197,,,"On Monday the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released inflation figures for July-2020 showing headline inflation rate at a 28-month high of 12.82% y/y for the month, 26bps up from 12.56% y/y in June.On a month-on-month basis, the headline index rose by 1.25% in July from 1.21% in June.Meanwhile, the core inflation rate eased by about 3bps to 10.10% y/y, declining for the first time since Oct-2019. On a monthly basis, the core inflation rate slowed to 0.75% from 0.86% in June.Food inflation index rose by 31bps to 15.48% y/y in July, also a 28-month high. Month-on-month, food prices rose by 1.52% in July from 1.48% in June.We note that inflation rate for July was driven by the pressure in food prices amid continued border closure and FX pressure in the country. The imported food index rose 16.35% y/y in July.We note reports of herder-farmer clashes in some parts of the country disrupting farming activities, the addition of maize to the list of items restricted from the Central Bank of nigeria (CBN)â€™s forex sales in July, as well as an increase in the retail price of PMS.The NBS reports that average price paid by consumers for premium motor spirit (petrol) decreased by -0.97% y/y and increased m/m by 11.44% to N143.63 in Jul-2020 from N128.88 in Jun-2020.We note that the farming calendar has also been upended by COVID-19 and shifting rainfall patterns induced by climate change which has led to a late wet planting season. Although we learnt that farmers not depending on rained agriculture are currently harvesting their crops.In July also, urban inflation rate printed higher at 13.4% y/y from 13.18% y/y in June while rural inflation rate jumped to 12.28% y/y from 11.99% y/y in June. On a monthly basis, both rural and urban inflation rates also spiked.According to the NBS, in July, headline inflation rate on a year-on-year basis was highest in Bauchi (16.10%), Kogi (15.90%) and Sokoto and Plateau (15.20%), while Lagos (10.70%), Adamawa (10.60%) and Kwara (10.50%) recorded the slowest rise in headline y/y inflation rate. On month on month basis, however, the headline inflation rate was highest in Kogi (2.85%), Zamfara (2.44%) and Yobe (2.35%), while Ondo (0.67%), Adamawa (0.63%) and Ogun and Imo (0.62%) recorded the slowest rise in m/m headline inflation rate. ImplicationThe steady rise in the inflation rate, now at its highest in over two years, compares woefully to the declining rates in the Nigerian fixed income space. Consequently, investors are contending with deeper negative real-yields.For consumers, rising prices pare purchasing power and imposes larger budget constraints. Also, we see manufacturers facing difficulties in passing on their costs to their consumers as FX pressures mount. OutlookWe see inflation rate continuing its upward trend as food price pressure persists. Moreso, the earlier stated disruptions to the farming calendar that led to a late wet planting season supports our view for a steady rise in price levels.However, we note CBNâ€™s promise to resume dollar sales to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators when international flights resume on August 29 which could help relieve pressure in the parallel market but we maintain an unfavourable outlook for the naira in H2-2020.Our expectation is for transportation prices to remain elevated in the near-term as domestic PMS price tracks conditions in the global oil market.SOURCE:https://brandspurng.com/2020/08/22/food-price-pressure-stokes-inflation-to-28-month-high-in-july/"

When Gowon and Ojukwu were heading to Ghana for Aburi Accord, they didn't know Ghana was a ""wannabe country"". You say all this, Yet you expect them to respect and treat you well. Your statement is not too different from the general view of the average Nigerian. So why am I suprised.Ok For those of you who don't know or have chosen not to know, it was Nigerian that showed Ghana and other African countries how to break ecowas laws. First you chased away other Africans, mainly Ghanaians from your country, few years after you had signed to be part of an organization(ecowas)  which you headquartered, and you are supposed to be the leader. Most of you argue that Ghana did it first, but when Ghana did theirs there was nothing like ecowas, Ecowas was founded in 75, Ghanaians we're chased away in 83. Indeed the Ghanaians Government that started the alience compliance order were Nkrumahs adversaries who were opposed to his African agenda. Ghana had always been accommodating to other Africans since beginning. You can ask Hausas and Yorubas.  Had ecowas existed in the 60s, Ghanaians wouldn't have tried that knowing very well what it will do to it's image. Secondly, nigeria governments in the past release a list they call import prohibition list which bans items, that can be produced in nigeria example chocolates, even those produced in Ghana. Mind you these have happened over several regimes. Even though I must admit the authorities have relaxed the enforcement of such laws in recent times. Then we come to the recent border closure, in a blantant disregard for ecowas you shut down your border to your neighbours, while your products were all over in Ghana. You were cheering your Government for that. Some were even boasting about how you were about to cripple Ghana's economy. You did all these while fully knowing ecowas rules. As a Ghanain I must admit I am not too happy about this, I wish we work together with one vision and mission as Africans.  But you set a precedence and others followed, you have no moral right to cry foul now."

1217,,,"• Operators, Service Providers Put Daily Losses At Millions Of Dollars • Smuggling Still Rife – Experts• closure Against ECOWAS Treaties, Wards Off Investors• Customs, Farmers, Manufacturers Differ On GainsAlmost a year after President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the closure of nigeria’s land border with Benin Republic and, by extension, other neighbouring countries, goods by local manufacturers, especially companies registered under the ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS), have remained at the borders as many of the consignments near expiration. Although the Federal Government claims to have recorded some gains from the border closure that took effect on August 20, 2019, especially in the area of rice and fuel smuggling to neighbouring countries, latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics and some members of the organised private sector show that the country might actually be at the losing end. While the closure was speculated to last 28 days, government has not given a definite timeline for the re-opening of the borders, as affected companies and exporters have had to subsequently move their goods through the sea ports. And given the perennial congestion at Apapa wharf, the process has been a nightmare. From rising food inflation to higher costs of logistics and loss of business to other suppliers in the global value-chain, the closure of the borders might have spurred domestic agricultural industry, but production capacity remains inadequate to meet rising demands of food and raw materials.  While farmers crave that the borders remain shut for as long as possible in order to continue to enjoy the monopoly in the local markets despite supply gaps, the Manufacturers Association of nigeria (MAN) stated that the negative effect of the border closure is far reaching and would linger even after the border is opened. With a minimum of five trucks from each of the manufacturers stuck on either side of the border, the operators lamented the weekly loss of at least $1million from the export business per operator, considering that the consignments cannot be moved back nor out of the Nigerian border. Worst hit by the border closure are companies such as Unilever, Nestlé, Cadbury, Flour Mills, Honeywell and PZ Industries, among others, as some of their trucks had been trapped at the Seme border since August 19, 2019. Similarly, the operators raised concerns about the continued closure and its possible impact on the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) expected to kick off next year, having being delayed for implementation in July.Unilateral border closures go against all commercial and freedom of movement treaties signed under the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Besides, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the nation’s inflation rate has maintained a steady rise from 11.98 per cent recorded in December 2019 to 12.56 per cent in June 2020. Food inflation equally rose to 15.18 per cent. Members of the Organised Private Sector (OPS), including manufacturers and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), have decried continued closure of the nation’s border for a drill, citing that goods meant for export to other regional markets were trapped on the corridor. For instance, some members of the food, beverage and tobacco sub-sector of the Manufacturers Association of nigeria, who are involved in export, decried the continued stance of the Federal Government on border closure.In particular, access to raw materials for manufacturers of cocoa beverages have become more difficult. Prior to the closure of the border, cocoa beverage manufacturers imported cocoa from neighbouring countries like Ghana through trucks via the land borders rather than through the seaports.However, the closure of the border has forced them to move their raw materials through the seaports, which, according to them, makes freight more expensive. Additionally, raw materials take longer time to reach factories thus increasing production lead time. Furthermore, FMCGs with strong export operations have seen their export activities significantly affected as they can no longer push goods through the land borders to the West African markets where they have core export operations. Essentially, they are required to pass through the seaports, which makes distribution cost more expensive, while delivery time takes longer. Accordingly, importing and exporting goods via the seaports has exposed more FMCGs to the Apapa menace.President, National Association of Nigerian Traders (NANTS) and member of the ECOWAS Task Force, Ken Ukaoha, in a chat with The Guardian, said the reason why the borders have remain closed or its re-opening may have been delayed, may not be unconnected with the implementation of the COVID-19 protocols.He, however, warned that the border closure was becoming a bit too late and dicey, as majority of goods have been stranded and abandoned at the border till this time. “71 per cent of the goods belong to Nigerians. At a time when the pandemic is affecting many businesses, this would have served as a form of incentive considering that a lot of investments are stuck at the borders; yet, we seek revenues from loans when revenues can be sourced easily. “Over 53 per cent of the goods are agro-based and have a short life-span. It does not bring any benefit to the country to see them waste. The longer we delay the re-opening of the borders or allow genuine goods to be picked up, the more we unwittingly inform businesses that there are no incentives to doing the right things. “Operators support the actions of the government. The action should have been for a moment and not unnecessarily prolonged as it not a deterrent action but a frustration to business actors”, he added.He noted that the Federal Government’s action has brought bad blood between nigeria and neighbouring countries, leading to a reciprocal action in such countries against Nigerian traders. “As a member of ECOWAS Task Force, while nigeria was right in closing the borders to bring sanity, ECOWAS has done a good job in bringing the actors to the table. 15 points were raised, 13 had been complied with pre-COVID. The remaining two were being worked upon. Niger and Benin have shown willingness to comply. The Nigerian government should also do the needful. “The haulage companies are stranded as their trucks remain at the borders with no end in sight; goods cannot be transloaded into another truck. This has consequences for the companies whose businesses rely solely on those trucks. The worst of it is that government would not talk about compensation having kept the goods for such a long period,” he said.The Chairman, MAN Export Promotion Group (MANEG), Ede Dafinone, said due to the current border situation, many companies are in dire problems, saying that significant losses and many businesses are about to collapse.He stressed that there are companies who rely on the West African market for additional sales to make profits, while some manufacture locally in nigeria for export, but have had their warehouse filled with unsold inventory. Dafinone said: “It is a year on and clearly, all those who are exporting through the land borders have been impacted. Very few companies have found a way to use coastal vehicles, notwithstanding the additional costs that come with the multiple handling in the process. “While there are companies that manufacture palm oil locally as well as other commodities that may have benefitted significantly from the border closure, there is a net loss to the economy in terms of export revenue. The border closure has dragged on for long without any sign of when it will be opened. This puts the country as a risky place for long-term investments. Investors will always be wary of investing in the economy. “From the government side, there may have be an increase in revenue from payable duty but Customs should be trade facilitating agency rather than a revenue-generating agency.”The LCCI had in its reaction, stated that the government ought to be more strategic and tactical in dealing with problems of this nature. LCCI Director-General, Muda Yusuf said: “The border closure is a simplistic solution to a complicated, broader and multidimensional problem. We should develop the culture of tackling the causes of problems, not fighting the symptoms. This is the way to solve a problem sustainably. “One of the critical challenges we face as a nation is that of weak state institutions. This is what has manifested in the escalation of the phenomenon of smuggling. It is regrettable that innocent citizens that are struggling to make a living are now being made to pay the price for lapses of ineffectual institutions of the state. “The truth is that government agencies at our borders have not lived up to their mandates. It is impossible for the scale of smuggling being reported to take place without the connivance of state officials at the borders. The starting point in dealing with this problem is to get the state institutions to do their job.“border closure does not offer a sustainable solution. It only penalises small players in the informal sector. It disrupts the supply chains and exports transactions of many big firms that do business across the sub-region. The cost of this closure to businesses is evidently phenomenal and would be in billions of naira. It also has implications for the confidence of investors as well.” Yusuf urged the government to strengthen the capacity of state institutions at the borders, by deploying greater use of technology in tackling the problem.Hitherto, the Comptroller-General, nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Hameed Ali, while speaking at a stakeholders’ forum on border closure, organised by the LCCI earlier in the year, said nigeria’s neighbours do not want to comply with the ECOWAS protocols on the transit of goods, adding that most of the goods imported into the countries were destined for nigeria. Ali, who was represented by the Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs, Mrs Kaycee Ekekezie, stated that the country has been able to record some gains since the closure of the borders. “Experience has shown that our neighbours do not comply with the ECOWAS protocols. The protocols on transit of goods demands that when a transit container berths at the seaport, the receiving country is mandated to escort same without tampering with the seal to the border of the destination country and hand over to the customs officials of the destination country. “Rather, they break the seals of containers on transit to nigeria at their ports and trans-load the goods on open trucks, which belong to their country from where same is trans-loaded on to Nigerian trucks. Unfortunately, all previous efforts, including provision of nine escort vehicles to them, yielded no positive change,” he added.Ali noted that the country would continue to engage with neighbouring countries through diplomatic channels to ensure compliance on transit trade.https://m.guardian.ng/news/one-year-on-multibillion-naira-goods-stuck-at-seme-border/"

There is no reason for me to miss you... do I pay your rent? Do I provide food for you? Why are you missing me?"" she added, still laughing.The quirky humor in the video earned Majimbo many reshares and more than 250,000 views from users across the continent, including South Africa, Kenya and nigeria.She told CNN she did not expect the video to get as much attention as it did, but many people related to it.""It was the time we had just gotten to lockdown, and everyone was telling me they missed me, and I literally like being away from people, so I thought to myself, 'Let me make a video about that,'"" she said.""I did not expect all the attention, but it happened, and I am glad it did.""Since going viral, Majimbo has made more videos combining dry humor and criticism around the subject matters she decides to film about.Many of the videos have more than 250,000 views on Instagram and an average of 50,000 views on Twitter.Some of the videos have also been featured on American owned cable channel, Comedy Central.Eating crunchy chipsMajimbo often incorporates eating crunchy chips, which has become one of her signature moves, to emphasize her points in her monologues.""In the first video that trended, I ate chips.

It therefore extended the positive sentiment for the fourth consecutive week on strong buying pressure, propelled by corporate earnings that beat market expectations and sectoral rotation.Cases of the novel Coronavirus pandemic across the globe continue amidst the easing of lockdowns by countries which have reopened their borders for economic activities, triggering production activities and impacting commodity prices, especially crude oil that has remained in the uptrend. Besides the oil price recovery and the earnings reporting season have supported the global stock markets and the NSE amidst the geopolitical tension, mixed economic outlook and fundamentals, with the UK’s economy already slipping into what has been termed its worst recession.nigeria’s hyperinflation, made worse by the latest currency devaluation are investors’ worst nightmares, even with the weakening foreign reserves and its ability to withstand these situations, which could delay economic recovery or worsen the prevailing state. This has resulted in speculations that weakened the exchange rate of the Naira against major currencies. With factors driving inflation on the increase, ranging from the continued border closure since August last year, low interest rate regime, hike in the pump price of fuel resulting high cost transportation, heightening insecurity, imported inflation due high exchange rate at the black market and the coronavirus outbreak that had weakened the purchasing power of Nigerians as the combined rate of underemployment and unemployment in the country hit 55.7% at the end of the 2020 Q2, threatening its socio-economy.Movement Of NSEASILast week, the positive momentum slowed down from the previous week’s uptrend as the NSE All-Share index recorded three session of losses and two up markets, after opening on a slightly negative note at 0.06%. This was extended to Tuesday when the margin of loss increased to 0.41% amidst mixed sentiment after profit taking worsened. This was halted at midweek when the index closed 1.04% up, reversing the trend. This was sustained on Thursday when the benchmark index gained 0.38% before pulling back on profit booking among high cap stocks on Friday, closing 0.15% down. This reduced the week’s total gain to 0.63%, lower than the previous week 1.41% positive close.Specifically, the NSEASI gained 157.95 basis points, after opening at 25,041.89bps, touching an intra-week high of 25,236.97bps, from its low of 24,841.94bps on a positive buying sentiments and profit taking,  driven by the better-than-expected earnings from companies, as well as sector rotation. This was linked to portfolios repositioning by retail and institutional investors on the strength of the recent half-year earnings reports released as revealed by the week’s traded volume. The composite index closed the week up at 25,199.84ps, in the same vein, market capitalization rose by N82.46bn, closing at N13.15tr, from the previous week’s N13.1tr, also representing a 0.63% value gain.During the week, over 9 companies released their half-year scorecards and full-year earnings reports for March 31, 2020 ended financial year from Northern nigeria Flour Mill, Tripple Gee, Lasaco Association, and Goldlink Insurance.  Directors of NNFM, Tripple Gee and Lasaco recommended a dividend of 15 kobo, 0.055 kobo and 0.05 kobo respectively. Also, within the week, the share price of Cornerstone Insurance was adjusted for a bonus of seven shares for every 30 held.Consumer goods and high priced stocks dominated the top advancers’ table, even as decliners outnumbered the gainers in the ratio of 33:29, while the impetus behind the week’s performance was relatively strong, with Money Flow Index reading 66.88bps from prior week’s 71.24ps. This reflects the increased buying interests in the face of the seeming profit-taking and selloffs on portfolio rebalancing.The NSE’s index action has again formed the double top chart pattern on a weekly time frame that signals pullback or correction depending market forces, as the index continues to trade above its 20-Day Moving Average. At the same time it is heading to breakout the 50-DMA and 50% line of Fibonacci retracement on above average traded volume that indicates the wait-and-see attitude of market players as interim dividend paying stocks financials are expected any moment from the new week. However, we envisage profits booking ahead, as the interim dividend yield of some companies are thinning out on relatively high prices.On a daily and weekly time frame MACD remain bullish, supporting an uptrend and changing momentum in the market on the increasing numbers of earnings reports that are above expectation. The buy volume for the period stood at 91%, and money flow index at 66.88 points.Mixed Sectoral IndicesThe performance index across the sectors were mixed, with the NSE Industrial Goods and Banking closing 2.71% and 0.03% lower respectively, while the NSE Oil/Gas index led advancers after gaining 5.92%, followed by the NSE Consumer and Insurance that closed 2.25%  and 1.12% higher respectively.  In addition to the general market, over the most recent period, therefore the overall outlook remained mixed and bullish in the short-term. Investors should focus on diversifying their long-term trades, especially agribusiness, healthcare, industrial goods and telecoms which have shown the most strength. Transactions for the week, in terms of volume and value, were up by 24.3% and 28.98% respectively as market players exchanged 1.33bn shares worth N13.93bn from the previous week’s 1.07bn units valued at N10.8bn. The week’s volume was boosted by trades in financial services, conglomerates and consumer goods stocks, especially Guaranty Trust Bank, Transacorp, Zenith Bank, Access Bank and Guinness.The best performing stocks for the week were Cadbury and Nigerian Breweries which gained 12.88% and 12.50% respectively, closing at N7.45 and N36.00 per unit on market forces and major shareholders increasing their stakes respectively.  On the flip side, Champion Brewery and Ikeja Hotel lost 25.26% and 25% respectively, closing at N0.71 and N0.84 per share on weak earnings and selloffs.Market OutlookWe expect mixed sentiment and profit taking to continue as MTNN, Flourmills and others will be adjusted for dividends declared by their boards, funds flowing into expected government bond and dividend paying stocks ahead of July inflation reports from NBS.  This is coming amidst reactions to the many impressive half-year reports that beats market expectation spurred retail and institutional investors to reposition their portfolios on the strength of these companies earnings power and future prospects.We cannot also rule out investors pricing in government’s inconsistent, mismatch policies and weak macroeconomic data as labour market report released by NBS which revealed the worse state of the nation unemployment and its threats to the economy. Already, the hyperinflation which has risen above the Central Bank of nigeria’s benchmark Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 12.5%, even as the declining industrial productivity points to the reality of a recession.The sectoral rotational wave will help investors cash in on low cap stocks and sectors that have suffered huge losses before now. Already investors are looking the way of healthcare, airline service providers, oil marketing stocks, banking among sectors likely to be impacted positively in the much anticipated global and domestic economic recovery.Also, the possibility of continued funds inflow to low priced stocks is high, due to the higher yields and upside potentials, considering the low rates on offer in the money and bond markets. In the meantime, investors should also look out for developments around the implementation of the CBN’s funding plan for small and medium scale businesses. Already, we notice that investors are taking position in healthcare and other defensive stocks likely to survive this meltdown, as seen in the increased trading in them, even as the global markets continue on the recovery path, with the gradual easing of the lockdown.While discerning investors should prepare to take advantage of stocks revaluation to position for the medium to long-term, it is noteworthy that the Nigerian equity market is selling at a discount and therefore offers high upside potential.Expect a pullback that will support the upside potential, especially with many fundamentally sound stocks remaining underpriced, and the dividend yield of major blue-chips continuing to look attractive in recent weeks, we expect speculative trading to shape the market’s direction, despite the seeming mixed outlook.To position for the short to long-term, investors should target fundamentally sound, dividend-paying stocks, for possible capital appreciation in the coming months. Also, traders and investors need to change their strategies, because of the NSE’s pricing methodology, the CBN directives, and their impact on the economy in the nearest future.Ambrose OmordionCRO|Investdata Consulting Ltdinfo@investdataonline.cominfo@investdata.com.ngambrose.o@investdataonline.comambroseconsultants@yahoo.comTel: 08028164085, 08032055467https://investdata.com.ng/mixed-sentiments-may-linger-amid-adjustment-of-mtnn-flourmills-prices/"

1227,,,"You folks are not wise. You think it is nigeria where any foreigner can come in to do anything? Just look at the fee Lagos State charges Uber and Bolt. Is it not the same as local companies. Who is unwise here? nigeria of course. It is the government responsibility to protect its citizens and businesses from foreign takeover. I don't blame Ghana. It is their country and they have the right to impose rules that pleases them. Let nigeria also take care and protect its citizens and business as well. You don't say because of foreign investment, allow foreigners takeover. Most investment in nigeria is done by Nigerians and not by foreigners. Nigerian diaspora send home several fold of billion dollars every year. In 2019 alone, Nigerian diaspora sent home $17.57 billion compared to foreign direct investment of just $3.3 billion. And not to talk about investment done by Nigerians based at home. Who should the priority be for? Nigerian businesses or foreign ones?"
